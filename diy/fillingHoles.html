<section id="0"><h1>Terminology</h1>
  <i>Setting</i> refers to the initial stage in which a material undergoes a transformation from a wet or pliable state to a solid or rigid state. This process often involves physical or chemical changes that enable the material to become hard enough to be worked with or shaped.

  <p>
    <i>Curing</i> refers to the subsequent process during which a material continues to develop its properties and achieve its ultimate strength, durability, and other desired characteristics. Curing occurs after the material has set.
  </p>

  <i>Drying</i> primarily involves the removal of moisture or solvents, whereas setting involves chemical or physical changes that result in the hardening of the material.

<section id="1"><h1>Things to consider</h1>
  <a href="https://t.ly/jXo1f">Gyproc easifill 60 filler</a> is what I am leaning towards.

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting and drying time</li>
      The more time it takes to set and dry, the more flexibility one will have on larger products.

      <p>
        <li>Shrinkage and cracking</li>
      </p>
    </ul>
  </p>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>When to sand</h1>
  <p>
    Sanding a filler too early can result in:
    <ul>
      <li>Incomplete filling</li>
      Sanding a filler while it's dried but not set may remove some of the material prematurely which could result in an uneven or incomplete filling of the gaps. 

      <p>
        <li>Poor adhesion</li>
        Sanding too early can disturb the bonding of the filler to the substrate. Filler materials are designed to adhere to the surface and form a solid bond. Sanding too soon can weaken this bond and reduce the effectiveness of the repair.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </p>

  To achieve the best results, it's generally advisable to wait until the filler has fully set but has not yet fully cured before sanding.
