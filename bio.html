        Proposed a real-time method to adaptively tune the feed-forward torque contribution for a ﬂeet of bots. This was then successfully tested as a proof of concept and its implementation seen through till production.
      </li>
      <p>
        A feedforward demand can be broken down into zero-order, velocity, acceleration and deceleration feedforward demands. The latter 3 demands are proportional to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The target velocity, acceleration and deceleration respectively
          </li>
          <li>
            The payload mass a bot is carrying
          </li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <li>
          Improved the real-time trajectory generator for fast movements along linear axis, in terms of limited precision of floating point arithmetic on 32 bit hardware.
        </li>
      </p>

      <li>
        Carried out detailed analysis and improved the localisation method using simple IR sensors.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The grid is made of cells of supposedly fixed lengths, but they are not always accurate.
        </li>

        <p>
          <li>
            The bots have IR sensors on all 4 sides that point downwards and can be used to detect cell-crossings (movement from gap to track to gap etc). But, they are not always mounted correctly.
          </li>
        </p>

        <li>
          The bots have a passive fifth wheel which should give an estimate of the bot's position, but it is not always accurate due to indentations on the tracks. 20 encoder counts is not always equivalent to 1mm.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With some filtering (exponential smoothing, jitter compensation, disturbance rejection, low-pass filtering) and non-volatile memory retention, the 2 sensors can be used to estimate the position of the bot at any given time.
      </p>

        <li>Helped in the modeling and tuning of a hoist system.</li>
        The hoist system consists of a motor attached via belt mechanisms to 4 steel tapes that spool and unspool as the motor rotates clockwise and anticlockwise. Attached to the tapes is a tote-gripper mechanism that can be engaged/disengaged to pick up or drop a tote.

    An <i>optical interrogator</i>, helpful in sensing strain or temperature differences, is useful in structural health monitoring systems. In the below project, a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) laser was used. The laser had to be swept through a range of wavelengths (40k) per second. Based on the physical property of the medium (say strain), the received optical signal peaked at different wavelengths.

  <subsection id="1.2"><h1>Dyson</h1>
    I worked as an Embedded Electronics Engineer in the Tech Research team within the broader division of New Products Innovation. For my first project I designed a mechanical contraption (3d printed) coupled with a strain gauge (in a wheatstone bridge format) to detect deflections when moved over an object. This was a proof of concept. 

    <p>
      For my 2nd project, I was involved in evaluating different computer vision techniques for detecting gaps in materials. This involved:
      <ul>
        <li>Selecting the projection pattern</li>
        Fringe lines vs IR dot pattern similar to the ones used by the iphone for face recognition. For a surface with no sharp undulations, this method provides a form of texture that help computer vision algorithms detect features in the surface.

        <p>
          <li>Decision between 2 vs 1 camera</li>
          <li>Decision between cameras</li>
          <li>Test of image segmentation algorithms (different kernels)</li>
        </p>
      </ul>
    </p>

    For my 3rd project, I worked on designing the communication interface between a new camera (not yet out in the market) and an FPGA so that we could stream videos quickly. Computer vision algorithms for object detection and segmentation were implemented by other team members over the video stream.

    <p>
      For my 4th project, I worked on 3 sensors in parallel:
      <ul>
        <li>Spectral sensing</li>
        The aim was to detect change in material properties as it underwent a change in temperature. I assisted the mechanical team in the setup of the sensor (a spectral detector of a range of wavelengths) and in the post analysis of the signal. 

        <p>
          <li>Fringing electric fields</li>
          This had to be desinged from scratch. A concept very similar to how capactive mobile touch screens work was designed using conductive plates with a thin non-conductive substrate on top. This was designed as a proof of concpet to detect moisture in materials.
        </p>

        <li>Infrared sensing</li>
        Created a proof of concept (mechanical setup) to detect the presence or absence of moisture using infrared wavelengths. An emitter/detector setup had to be created along with a transmission medium for the light to pass through and interact with the water droplets.
      </ul>
    </p>

    Whilst I cannot disclose any information on the projects I worked on at Dyson, I can provide pictures of a fun <a href="https://t.ly/RLTCw">comptetion</a> our team took part in. We were supposed to create a bot that can deliver cargos (small cardboard boxes) to the right locations whilst also sabotaging and avoiding getting sabotaged by other bots. I designed the 3d printed belt-gears and the CNC-cut wheels. We came second.
