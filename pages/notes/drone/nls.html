<section id="0"><h1>The problem with non-linearities</h1>
  We want to infer the location of a vehicle from position measurements which are received one at a time when the vehicle is stationary. But now the measurements are noisy and a nonlinear function of the position. Maybe the measurements tell us something about the orientation.

  $$
    \tilde{y} = h(x) + v
  $$
  $x$ is a constant unknown state vector of length $n$.
  <br>
  $\tilde{y}$ is the vector of $m$ measurements (of $x$) that is actually received.
  <br>
  $v$ is the unknown error/noise vector with zero mean and known covariance
  <br>
  $h$ is the measurement function (<n>constant and known</n>, but non-linear)

  <p>
    Before we had a linear function which meant we could write the function as a matrix $H$ times $x$.
  </p>

  $h$ is now a problem. In recursive estimation, we were projecting the measurement distribution into the same state space as the estimate. We had our estimate $x$ and $p(x)$. We had some distribution of measurements $y$ and $p(y)$. The mean of the distribution was given by $Hx$ and the covariance was $R$.

  </div>
  We could use the linear matrix $H$ to project Gaussian distributions in the measurement space into the state space. The fact that the measurements were related by a linear function ($H$) ensured that the projected distribution stayed Gaussian. That meant that the weighted average posterior distribution was Gaussian as well.

  </div>
  But if $h$ is an arbitrary function, we have no guarantees that the projected distribution of $y$ will stay Gaussian; <m>which makes it a lot harder to take a weighted average between the prior $\hat{x}_0$ and what the new measurements are telling us</m>.

  <p>
    The problem is, if we want to preserve the Gaussian to Gaussian mapping, we need to find a way to make the measurement model linear.

<section id="1"><h1>Calculating the Jacobian</h1>
  A common thing to do when linearising a nonlinear function, is to take the Taylor series approximation of $h$ around the estimate $\hat{x}_0$:

  $$
    h(x) \approx h(\hat{x}_0) + H_{\hat{x}_0}(x-\hat{x}_0)
  $$
  
  $H_{\hat{x}_0}$ is the first derivative of $h$ evaluated at $\hat{x}_0$.
  <br>
  Notice the 'approximately equal to' sign.

  <p>
    This is similar to some of the linearization done in controls. If $x$ and $y$ are scalars, then the first derivative is a scalar as well. $H_{\hat{x}_0}$ would be a simple derivative.
  </p>

  But if $x$ and $y$ are vectors of length $n$ and $m$ respectively, then from linear algebra, the first derivative is a matrix called the <i>jacobian</i>. $H_{\hat{x}_0}$ would be equal to a matrix with the individual partial derivative components in the various locations in the matrix.

  $$
    H_{\hat{x}_0} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial{h_1}}{\partial{x_1}} & \cdots & 
    \frac{\partial{h_m}}{\partial{x_1}} \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    \frac{\partial{h_1}}{\partial{x_n}} & \cdots &
    \frac{\partial{h_m}}{\partial{x_n}}
    \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  Since we know both $\hat{x}_0$ and $h$, we can compute the jacobian and the function evaluated at the prior mean $h(\hat{x}_0)$, which lets us rewrite all of this in a linear form which is the form we need for a cursive estimation to work:

  $$
    h(x) \approx Ax + b
  $$
  
  As a result the maximum a posteriori algorithm is basically unchanged, with just an extra step of linearization; that is constructing the jacobian.

  <p>
    Our three steps are now:
    <ul>
      <li>Construct the jacobian $H_{\hat{x}_0}$ to get a linear approximation of $h$ around the estimated state</li>

      <p>
        <li>Compute the posterior covariance</li>
        $$
          Q_1 = (Q^{-1}_0 + H^T_{\hat{x}_0}R^{-1}H_{\hat{x}_0})^{-1}
        $$
      </p>

      <li>Compute the posterior mean estimate</li>
      $$
        \hat{x}_1 = \hat{x}_0 + Q_1H^T_{\hat{x}_0}R^{-1}(\tilde{y} - h(\hat{x}_0))
      $$
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  We now have the ability to take in a series of measurements of an unknown quantity, where the measurements are non-linear function of the unknown quantity. Assuming that we have gaussian noise being injected into the system to perturb the measurements, we can still recover a reasonable estimate.

  <p>
    We'll see how specific sensors can plug into this formulation, to relax the assumption about the vehicle moving using the Kalman filter.
