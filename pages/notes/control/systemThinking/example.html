  The aim is to design a control system that will keep a ball on top of an inverted bowl. The first step is to understand the behaviour of the entire system i.e. how is the estimated ball position affected by a command applied to the fan.

  <subsubsection><h1>Fan dynamics</h1>
    If a step command <n>input</n> is applied to the fan, for example, to go from off to half of its max speed:

    <ul>
      <li>
        [<n>timing</n>] There will be a delay as the fan has to accelerate over some time period to get to the required speed.
      </li>
      <li>
        After which there will be some variation in fan speed due to <n>physical disturbances</n> in the system. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The output of the fan system is air velocity which is subsequently the input into the inverted bowl dynamics.   
      </li>
    </ul>
  </subsubsection>
 
  <subsubsection><h1>Inverted bowl dynamics</h1>
    The bowl dynamics system calculates the force on the ball from the air and uses that force to determine how the ball moves. 
 </subsubsection>

 <subsubsection><h1>Radar sensor dynamics</h1>
    The true ball position is then sent to the radar sensor model which produces a relative distance to the radar gun. The radar system introduces:
    
    <ul>
      <li>More delay</li>
      <li>Errors in the measurement</li>
    </ul>
  </subsubsection>

  <subsubsection><h1>Ball position estimator</h1>
    The relative ball position is then used to estimate where the ball is in the bowl frame which is the final output of the system.
  </subsubsection>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>System representation</h1>
  <n>The aim would then be to break the system down to manageable parts (simpler mathematical models) where each part is represented separately in isolation</n>, allowing engineers to work on the different parts simultaneously.

  <subsection id="2.0"><h1>Differential equations</h1>
    Differential equations could be used for the entire end-to-end system which relates fan commands to estimated ball positions, but this would be difficult to do because of how complex each of the parts are individually.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="2.1"><h1>Pure convolution</h1>
    The fan commands would first be convolved with the impulse response of the fan. The output, the air velocity, would then be convolved with the impulse response of the inverted bowl system. The output, the true ball position, would be convolved with the impulse response of the radar sensor to generate the measured ball's position. This output would then, finally, be convolved the estimator's impulse response to get the estimated position that results from the initial fan commands.

    <p>
      Performing integration multiple times becomes expensive in terms of time and computation. Convolution also doesn't allow combination of several systems into a single large system. 
    </p>
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Control system</h1>
  The final step would be to pull the model together and design the control system for it.
