<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>End-effector stiffness control</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  The aim is for the fingertip to act like a MSD. To achieve this, the controller would have to be implemented in the ee (instead of joint) coordinates; which means the dynamics would have to be considered in the ee coordinates instead of $q$. This is also called <i>cartesian stiffness control</i>.

  <p>
    For the end point to act like a MSD, the following dynamics needs to be imposed:
    $$\begin{equation}
      m\ddot{p}^c + b\dot{p}^c + k(p^c-p^{c_d}) = f^c_{ext}
    \label{eq:goal2}
    \end{equation}$$
  </p>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Change of coordinates</h1>
  The position of the end contact point of an arm is given by some kinematic function of its joint angles $q$, from which the velocity and acceleration (using chain rule) of the end contact point can be found.  
  $$\begin{align}
    p^c &= f_{kin}(q)                               \label{eq:position}\\
    \dot{p}^c &= J(q)\dot{q}                        \label{eq:velocity}\\
    \ddot{p}^c &= J(q)\ddot{q} + \dot{J}(q)\dot{q}  \label{eq:accel}\\
  \end{align}$$

  From the principle of virtual work, the applied joint torques is conserved as the applied translational forces at the end-effector:
  $$\begin{equation}
    u = J^T(q) f^c    \label{eq:jTorque}
  \end{equation}$$

  The manipulator equation in joint coordinates can be changed to end-effector coordinates by substituting \ref{eq:manipulator}, \ref{eq:jTorque} into \ref{eq:position}, \ref{eq:velocity}, \ref{eq:accel}:
  \begin{align}
    M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q})\dot{q} &= 
    \tau_g(q) + u + \sum_i J^T_i(q)f^{c_i}          \label{eq:manipulator}\\
    
    M_c(q)\ddot{p}^c + C_c(q, \dot{q})\dot{q} &=
    f^c_g(q) + f^c_u + f^c_{ext}                     \nonumber
  \end{align}

  $M_c(q) = (J M^{-1} J^T)^{-1}$ <br>
  $C_c(q,\dot{q}) = M_c \left(J M^{-1} C+ \dot{J} \right)$ <br>
  $f^c_g(q) = M_c J M^{-1} \tau_g$

  <p>
    $M_c$ is the EE mass or the effective mass. <br>
    $M$ is the mass of the original system. <br>
    $M^{-1}$ is the shorthand for $M^{-1}(q)$ <br>
    $J$ is the shorthand for $J^c(q)$
  </p>

  This transformation is often called <i>operation space form of the dynamics</i>. It is now possible to use feedback cancellation with this new dynamics in the operation/EE space.

  <p>
    Depending on the configuration of the robot mass in each axis, it is possible to control an arm to push back (hence acting more or less against the external push) when a physical force is applied on the EE on any of its axes.
  </p>

<section id="2"><h1>Validity of the dynamics in the operation space</h1>
  <subsection id="2.0"><h1>Is $M_c(q)$ invertible?</h1>
    In general, $(AA^T)^{-1}$ exists if $A$ has full row rank. For $(J M^{-1} J^T)^{-1}$ to be invertible, $J$ would have to be full row rank. In all reasonable parts of a robot arm's workspace, $J$ tends to be full row rank. 

    <p>
      For instance, in most cases $J(q) \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times n}$ where $n>3$, so $J$ is full row rank. The mass matrix is positive definite so that is well conditioned too.
    </p>

    There are however singular configurations like when an arm is stretched out, where the Jacobian is not invertible. 
    
    <p>
      In a singular configuration like the stretched out arm, the controller cannot produce force instantaneously at the end-effector in the direction the arm is stretched out in. <m>But, it can produce a force dot</m>, i.e. the arm can move backwards (by bending its elbow) from the singular configuration. 
    </p>
      
    Care must be taken when writing cartesian stiffness controllers in such singular configurations. Usually, they are written in a constrained least squares form with some boundaries on it - either the inverse of the Jacobian is not taken in singular conditions or much care is taken when doing it. 
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="2.1"><h1>Null space of a controller</h1>
    For a robot arm having 7 joints that acts like a certain dynamics in the xyz configuration, extra conditions/constraints need to be enforced on the joints so that they don't get into an odd configuration and bump somewhere. This is required to stabilise the null space of the controller.

    <p>
      This is similar to having a secondary objective in the null space of a Jacobian based controller, controlling a robot arm to stay in a comfortable joint configuration whilst its EE position is fixed and its joints are still moving.
    </p>

    Whilst, $u_c$ needs to be chosen such that the operation space dynamics looks similar to that of a MSD, nullspace stabilisation should also be added into the mix:

    $$
      M_c(q)\ddot{p}^c + C_c(q, \dot{q}) + K_p(p^c - p^{c^d}) + 
      \scriptsize {\text{Null space} \atop \text{Stabilisation}} = 
      f^c_{ext}
    $$

    The fact that $M, C$ tend to not be changed and that they are configuration dependent, means that a robot can be made to act like a MSD system only instantaneously. The mass that it acts like will be configuration dependent. 
    
    <p>
      In the quasi-static analysis case, if the accelerations are small, if a robot is pushed against to see how far it deflects, i.e. how much it can be pushed before it hits a new steady state and stops, the mass doesn't matter there. <m>Inertial terms don't matter in static analysis</m>. 
    </p>

    But in dynamic analysis, $M, C$ are going to be important to understand the dynamics of the robot. It may not be hugely important though. It would be beautiful and clean to make them somehow constant or a function of $q$. But, there are theoretical limits on how much a controller can be changed before it starts to get unstable. Neville Hogan has some great surveys on it.
