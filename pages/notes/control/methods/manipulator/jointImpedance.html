<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Joint impedance control</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  Most controllers choose to use the initial mass and coriollis terms in their desired dynamics. $M, C$ always go together (even in reality) and are similar to the $ma$ in $F=ma$. To cancel out $M, C$ requires good accuracy of the mass, which in turn requires high bandwidth. A control method that involves changing $M, C$ is called <i>joint impedance control</i>.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Examples</h1>
  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>Iiwa</h1>
    Iiwa does much more than just GC. In joint-impedance control mode, Iiwa also does friction compensation and some subtle stuff at the actuator level to cancel out the effective dynamics of the arm.  

    <subsubsection><h1>Mass cancellation</h1>
      Iiwa only compensates for the masses of the rotors and not for the whole robot. It's a very subtle, carefully designed control - $M$, $C$ are technically changed but not in the way of making a different effective mass. It's very similar to the feedback cancellation story but it's trying to do a little bit less (because it's not cancelling $M$,$C$ of the whole robot) and it's even more robust because of it.

  <subsection id="1.1"><h1>Opening a dishwasher door</h1>
    While opening a dishwasher door, a robot arm can deviate significantly from its joint trajectory depending on how accurately the location of the dishwasher door is modelled and captured.
    
    <subsubsection><h1>Opening the hinge of the dishwasher</h1>
      If the arm is trying to move down exactly based on some kinematic constraint given by the door of the dishwasher, if any of the models is even a little bit off (i.e. the door doesn't open the way it is modeled or the door handle isn't in the same place the model expects) then it pays a lot to be flexible enough to follow whatever contour is given by the actual position of the dishwasher and not by the model's course approximation.
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection><h1>Whilst opening the door</h1>
      The fingers will slip off if the arm is in too stiff of a mode. When the door is pushed down (to lay it flat when open) the arm should ideally still be in a joint impedance mode - it wouldn't be tracking the position trajectory accurately but it would still be able to accomplish the task.
