<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Stiffness control</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  The philosophy is for a robot to have a programed response to torque perturbations (if it was pushed or if it ran into something), instead of a rigid position control. A robot can be made to respond gracefully as if it were a different mechanical system, say a mass-spring-damper system:

  $$\begin{equation}
    m\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + kx = f
  \end{equation}$$

  This control technique is also referred to as <i>simple impedance control</i>. <i>Impedance control</i> is the more general term for the whole set of concepts.

<section id="1"><h1>Overview</h1>
  A big complicated robot can be made to act like a point robot at the end using a <i>stiffness controller</i>, wherein the end-effector's interactions to external forces are programed to be that of a mass-spring-damper. 

  <p>
    A stiffness controller can also be created to replace the effect of gravity (i.e. <i>gravity compensation</i>).

<section id="2"><h1>Benefit of having gravity compensation</h1>
  In practice, the difference in having a controller with just PD control and no gravity compensation is huge. 
  
  <p>
    If reasonable performance is desired without gravity compensation all over a system's state space with just a PD controller, $K_p$ would have to be very large. A large $K_d$ would also be needed to damp the effect of having a large $K_p$. If gravity is subtracted i.e. GC is used in the controller, then $K_p, K_d$ can be chosen to be much lower and the system can be much more responsive. 
  </p>
  
  In practice, when a robot not running GC gets bumped into, it may trigger a fault and power down. Using GC, would make the robot react soft enough to get out of the way.
