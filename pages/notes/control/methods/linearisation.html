  <p>
    A second order <i>linear differential equation</i> is of the form:

    $$
      \ddot{y} = c_1u_1 + c_2u_2 + c_3\phi + \cdots
    $$

    $c_1, c_2, \cdots$ are constants. There is no sine, cosine or multiplication of input and state (eg: $u \cdot phi$). A plot of LHS as a function of $u_1$ or $\phi$ or any of the other variables, would be a straight line. 
  </p>

  <subsubsection><h1>Benefits of linear equations</h1>

      <li>The tool set of linear control techniques is large</li>

    </ul>
  </subsubsection>

  <subsubsection><h1>Benefits of non-linear equations</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They capture the true physics of a system because of which they can make accurate predictions about how systems will change in time.
      </li>
      <li>
        These equations work at any angle for any control input. They don't break down when numbers get too big or too small.

<section id="1"><h1>Definition</h1>
  <i>Linearisation</i> is a useful mathematical tool that's used to tame the math when it becomes hard to work with. It is a process of creating a linear model from a non-linear equation. 

  <p>
    The fundamental idea is to approximate a non-linear equation <n>locally</n> by a linear one using the equation:

    $$
      f_{lin}(x) = f(x_{op}) + f'(x)\Bigr|_{x=x_{op}} \Delta{x}
    $$

    This says that the equation of the best linear approximation of a function around an operating point is the value of the original function plus its slope <n>around the operating point</n>, times the deviation from the operating point. 
  </p>

  <subsubsection><h1>Use</h1>
    For a 2D drone, it helps decouple the dynamics in the $y,z,\phi$ directions, which enables thinking about each of the directions separately.

<section id="2"><h1>Steps in linearisation</h1>
  <subsection id="2.0"><h1>Pick the operating point</h1>
    Choose some state of the non-linear system to linearise around. 

    <p>
      Since approximations due to linearisation are only valid in a small region around the operating point, it's helpful to <n>linearise around an equilibrium state</n>. An <i>equilibrium</i> exists when certain fixed and non-changing control input values can be found resulting in velocities and accelerations, at least in some dimensions, to be constant. Intuitively, this is a state that the vehicle can stay in for an extended period of time. 
    </p>

  <subsection id="2.1"><h1>Linearise sines and cosines</h1>
    Consider the consequences of an angle $\phi$ being close to zero. 
    
    <div class="container">

        <img style="height:80px; width:auto"
        src="../../../../figures/control/30a_lineariseSine.png"/>
        <figcaption>
          Zooming in, the graph of $y=sin\phi$ looks almost identical to $y=\phi$

          Zooming in, the graph of $y=cos\phi$ looks identical to $y=1$ when $\phi$ is small

    </div>
    Linearisation finds the line that is the tangent to the operating point. The tangent to $sin\phi$ at $\phi=0$ is $y=\phi$ and $cos\phi$ and its tangent line are equal to 1 when $\phi$ is small.
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection id="2.2"><h1>Linearise products of variables</h1>
    An example would be the multiplication of an input and a state. The key insight is that product of a very small number times a very small number, is a tiny number whose value is so small that it can be safely ignored; which leads to cancellation of terms.
  </subsection>

<section id="3"><h1>Example</h1>
  <div>
    <figure>
      <img style="height:100px; width:auto"
      src="../../../../figures/drone/41_linearisation.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        The curve is approximately: $f(x) = x^2$
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  To linearise a quadratic function as above around a (<i>operating</i>) point, say $x = 1$, a straight line that best approximates the function at the point needs to be found. This means the line has to pass through the point and also have the same slope as the function at the point. 

  <p>
    The solution is the tangent line at the operating point. The slope of the parabola at the operating point can be found using calculus and will match that of the tangent line. Zooming into the operating point, visually, the tangent and the parabola are very close to each other. This confirms the tangent is a good linear approximation of the parabola in the region. 
  </p>

  The linear equation that gives a good approximation of $f(x) = x^2$ when $x$ is close to 1 ends up being:
  $$\begin{align*}
    f_{lin}(x) &= 2x -1 \\
                &= 1 + 2(x-1)
  \end{align*}$$

  Break down of the solution equation:
  <ul>
    <li>$x-1$</li>
    This is $\Delta{x}$. It tells how far $x$ is from the operating point. When $x=0 \rightarrow -1$, when $x=1 \rightarrow 0$. 

    <li>$1$</li>
    It's the value of the original function at the operating point of $x = 1$.

    <li>$2$</li>
    It is the slope/derivative of the original function at the operating point.
  </ul>
