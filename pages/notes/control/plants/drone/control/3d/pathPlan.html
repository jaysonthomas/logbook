<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  A 3D motion planner outputs a sequence of x, y, z waypoints. 

  <p>
    A 3D controller needs target: x, y, z and yaw coordinates as a function of time. Additionally, this controller will ideally need the first derivatives of the x, y, and z coordinates as well.   
  </p>

  There are three main gaps between the output of the 3D motion planner and the input required for a 3D controller. 
  <ul>
    <li>Yaw</li>
    The target yaw is a completely separate variable. It is used to orient a camera on a drone for example. 

    <p>
      <li>Velocities</li>
      Initially, it is easier to assume a constant velocity motion with some speed decided in advance. 
    </p>

    <li>Time information</li>
    Initially, it is assumed a vehicle travels in a straight line between adjacent waypoints. Distance and velocity between waypoints can be used to assign target time to each waypoint. Some linear interpolation between waypoints is used to find the target position at any arbitrary time.
  </ul>

  This is a very rudimentary technique for smoothing waypoints. It results in trajectories with instantaneous changes in velocity at the waypoints. These trajectories are impossible for a vehicle to fly IRL. This is fine as long as it is acceptable for a vehicle's actual trajectory to deviate slightly from the target. And the vehicle is given enough of a buffer, so that it doesn't collide with any obstacles. In a more robust design, a different waypoint smoothing approach would be required.
