<section id="1"><h1>Trajectory</h1>
  On the left, is the trajectory input. For simplicity, assume the trajectory contains target values for x, y, z, yaw angle, and the associated velocities. It could also contain acceleration targets. This trajectory gets split into three parts: 
  
  <ul>
    <li>A z part: $z_t, \dot{z}_t$</li>
    <li>A lateral x and y part: $x_t, \dot{x}_t, y_t, \dot{y}_t$</li>
    <li>A yaw part: $\psi_t$</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Altitude controller</h1>
  The altitude controller is responsible for ensuring the vehicle stays close to the z-trajectory (commanded set position and velocity) by computing a target collective thrust value. Its role here is identical to what it was in the 2D case.

  <p>
    Inputs
    <ul>
      <li>Everything related to the target $z_t, \dot{z}_t$ and actual z, $z, \dot{z}$.</li>
      <li>Current estimated attitude $\phi, \theta, \psi$</li>
      This input is provided so that a drone can adjust its thrust when it is tilted. 
    </ul>
  </p> 
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Lateral position controller</h1>
  The x and y trajectory is first handled by the lateral position controller. The only difference from the y position controller in the 2D case is that this controller outputs linear acceleration targets rather than angular ones. This is just a design decision to keep the more complicated angular control logic enclosed within the roll-pitch controller.

  <p>
    Controlling lateral position is the most involved control loop. It is just a PD controller on the x, y trajectories, similar to that for controlling Y in the 2D case. It generates an acceleration command in the x and y directions, which is sent to the roll-pitch controller. 
  </p>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Yaw controller</h1>
  The yaw trajectory is handled by the yaw controller. Yaw is the least interesting of the control loops since it is controlled through the reactive moment command which only affects yaw. So yaw can be treated in isolation. 

  <p>
    In practice, if yaw does not matter for a specific application, its rate is set to zero and the exact yaw angle of the vehicle wouldn't even be cared about. By doing this, all available thrust and differential thrust is ensured to be used for the translational motion that matters.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>Roll-pitch controller</h1>
  Inputs:
  <ul>
    <li>Target thrust from the altitude controller</li>
    This is because the current commanded thrust needs to be shared in the x, y, and z directions. The thrust-component that points in x, y will determine acceleration in those directions. 

    <p>
      <li>Output from lateral position controller</li>
    </p>
  </ul>

  The cascaded structure (from the altitude and lateral position control blocks to the roll-pitch controller) is similar to the 2D case. The job of the roll-pitch controller is to take a thrust command as well as the desired x, y accelerations and the attitude (pitch, roll, yaw $\phi,\theta, \psi$) and output a target roll and pitch rate, p command and q command. 

  <p>
    These commanded p and q values get sent to the body rate controller. The body rate control is just the p controller that converts p, q, and r commands into three rotational moment commands. The r commands come from the yaw controller.
