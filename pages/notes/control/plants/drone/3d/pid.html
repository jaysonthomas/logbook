  Not every one of the blocks will be filled with a PID or even a PD controller since some of the blocks do not represent second order systems. 

  <p>
    In 2D control, each of the blocks represented a second order system. The altitude controller took a z target, along with its first and second derivative as an input. As an output, it produced a thrust which mapped directly to an acceleration which is the second derivative of the input z. Since the controller was responsible for hitting a target z by commanding its second derivative, it was a second order system. 
  </p>

  To stably control a second order system without oscillations, a PD controller is required at the very least. Sometimes, an I term is also useful but it can often be safely ignored.
  
  <p>
    The other two blocks in 2D control represented second order systems as well. For the 3D diagram, this isn't the case. The altitude controller in 3D is still be a PD controller since it's clearly a second order system.
  </p>
  
  But the yaw controller simply takes a yaw command as input and produces a yaw dot command as output, which is only a single derivative. This makes the yaw controller a first order system. This means that the yaw controller can be implemented as a P controller without any D term. 

  <p>
    The yaw controller isn't the only first order system in the diagram. The body rate controller and the role-pitch controller are also first order systems which will be controlled with p controllers. The implementations of the yaw and body rate controllers are pretty straightforward.     
  </p>

  The role-pitch controller is more complex since it is responsible for handling all the mathematical realness associated with transformations between the world and the body frames. <a href="https://t.ly/tkUjJ">Paper</a> that gives an overview of how this math works. It also includes the first order p control equation. Sections 3 and 4 are important. Equations 2, 4, 5, 6 are important.
