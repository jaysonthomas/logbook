<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Two-link Arm: Richer formulation of the pseudo inverse optimisation problem</h1>

<section id="0"><h1>Context</h1>
  While following a trajectory, a jacobian based controller can get very close to dropping rank (<i>singularity</i>). In such situations, the controller may command ridiculous joint velocities. Even worse, most robots will have some form of velocity limitation imposed further downstream; this velocity cap method will not be aware of the overall control objectives - the velocity would get saturated with the controller continuing to demand higher velocities and the robot may eventaully get into a fault state.

  <p>
    The pseudo-inverse can be made richer (giving it a better chance to pick the best solution possible) by specifying/making it aware of velocity/joint limits. The idea of optimisation and quadratic programming is a powerful framework.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Specifying constraints</h1>
  The standard choice is to pick linear constraints for the pseduo inverse optimisation problem. For instance, joint limits are a nonlinear function in general. But it can be approximated with an euler approximation which makes it a linear constraint. Position and acceleration limits are linear for any euler kind of integration step. Torque limits are not linear and its linearisation is tricky; but torque limits are generally not used. 

  <p>
    An example of a bad case is when a robot is up against a limit on one joint. For instance, the second joint moves along as if nothing happened and the first joint changes direction when a singularity is encountered, which means the ee goes off in the wrong direction. There will be feedback loops that eventually saves the robot. But even in an open loop framework, joint limits can be accounted for and a better controller can be formed right from the start.
  </p>

  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>QP formulation 1</h1>
    Find $\dot{q}$ such that $J^G(q)\dot{q} \approx V^G$.

    $$\begin{align*}
      min_{\dot{q}} \quad &\|J^G(q)\dot{q} - V^G\|^2 \\
      s.t. \quad & \|\dot{q}\| \leq \dot{q}_{max} \\
          & \text{joint/acceleration limits etc.}
    \end{align*}$$
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.1"><h1>QP formulation 2</h1>
    Here the joints are not controlled to run as close as possible to the desired velocity in the least squares sense. The objective is to pick joint angles that constrains the ee to always move in the direction of the desired velocity. When a limit is hit, the velocity is scaled down whilst keeping the direction of movement the same as the desired trajectory. This is a richer (also simpler) formulation that can be written as a quadratic program that maximises a linear objective as follows: 

    $$\begin{align*}
      max_{\dot{q}, \alpha} \; & \alpha \\
      s.t. \quad & J^G(q)\dot{q} = \alpha V^G \\
          & 0 \leq \alpha \leq 1 \\
          & \text{joint velocity/acceleration/position limits}
    \end{align*}$$

    $\dot{q}$ (vector), $\alpha$ (scalar) are the decision variables. The objective though is only in terms of one of the decision variables; the aim is to maximise the scalar $\alpha$ subject to the above conditions. $\dot{q}$ on the LHS must be chosen such that it matches some scaled version of the desired spatial velocity vector. 

    <p>
      Even though $\dot{q}$ is not part of the objective, when choosing a solution, it enters in via the equality constraint. So $\dot{q}$ can only live on the set of possible $\dot{q}$s such that $\dot{q}$ times the current Jacobian (LHS) moves the EE in the direction of the desired spatial velocity (RHS)! 
    </p>

    In essence, a $\dot{q}$ that will achieve the objective without any constraints is chosen and then scaled down i.e. the velocities of all the joints are shrunk by the same scaling in order to satisfy the constraints. The arm will always move in the desired direction - it would rather stop completely when deviating.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.2"><h1>Comparison of the 2 formulations</h1>
    The 2 methods only differ in how the solution is allowed to degrade in performance when the optimisation solver cannot satisfy the constraints perfectly. 
    
    <p>
      There is a choice in how performance can be given up, when there is no other option but a degradation in performance. In the 1st case, the objective is to find a joint spatial velocity that's as close as possible in the least squares sense to the desired ee spatial velocity. In the 2nd case, the joint velocity need not be as close as possible to the ee-velocity, as long as it stays constrained in the right direction.
    </p>

    <subsubsection><h1>Absence of constraints</h1>
      In the 2nd case, it's going to solve the problem exactly by choosing $\alpha = 1$ and making $\dot{q}$ exactly equal to the spatial velocity. As the constraints become active because the arm might be running up against them, then $\alpha$ will start to shrink as a method of graceful degradation.

      <p>
        In the 1st case if there are no limits, it will find $\dot{q}$ exactly to drive the objective to zero. As the constraints come on, it will find a different velocity but it might make the arm move in the wrong direction.
