<section id="0"><h1>Computing the pose of the EE using FK</h1>
  Given that the joint angles are known:
  <ul>
    <li>Compute pose of the EE relative to the wrist</li>
    The rotation matrix for the rotation joint is just a relative pose.

    <p>
      <li>Chain it backwards all the way to the world frame</li>
    </p>
  </ul>

  The math is simple because each individual joint is just describing a small rotation operation from right before the robot's joint until right after the robot's joint. This is how robots are specified in robot description files as relative poses of each link - 6 numbers: x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw. <i>Joints</i> are just operations that will make a transformation from the pre joint frame to the post-joint frame. 

</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Defining $q$</h1>
  <p>
    $q$ should be defined in such a way so as to be sufficient to tell us where all the attached bodies are in the world. In iiwa that's bolted down, all we need are 7 numbers of the different rotations of the different joints. But if we have a red brick on the table, we need enough something in $q$ to be able to eventually pull out the pose. 
  </p>

  In code, we define a $3\times 3$ rotation matrix for each joint based on the corresponding joint angle. We can then go through a series of frame transformations (through all the joints) to get the full kinematics. 
  <ul>
    <li>Iiwa</li>
    In iiwa, it's a $7\times 1$ vector of rotational joint angles representing the revolute joints. It's 7 because we choose to use quaternions in the coordinate representation to avoid gimbal locks and singularities.

    <p>
      <li>Allegro hand</li>
      It has 4 fingers with 4 links per finger. Total number of joint angles is 16. Plus, 7 numbers to configure its position in space. 
    </p>

    <li>Allegro hand picking up a brick</li>
    23 numbers for the hand and 7 for the brick. The kinematics problem then becomes going from the 30 numbers (representing q) to some pose of the brick and hand.
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Drake implementation</h1>
  To compute the FK in drake, we need to specify the frames to get the pose of the desired frame relative to some other frame expressed in some other frame.

  <p>
    The context is taken as the argument instead of $q$ because the kinematics can be parameterized. If we were designing a robot and we wanted to optimise the length of a link for instance. Then we'd like the kinematics to also be a function of the link lengths or some other quantities. Hence, this is useful.
  </p>

  The <i>context</i> is just state + parameters + time; it's just the structure that wraps it. 

  <p>
    Very often, quaternions is used to represent the position/orientation and rotation matrix is used to represent the pose $X$.
