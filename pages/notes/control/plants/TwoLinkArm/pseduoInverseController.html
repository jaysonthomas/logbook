        $\dot{q}^d$ is desired IIWA velocities, $V^{G^d}$ is desired spatial velocities.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  To compute the desired velocities, the pseudo inverse controller (PIC) needs:
  <ul>
    <li>a model of the robot (inside the block)</li>
    <li>current positions of the robot $q$</li>
    We could use the commanded/desired or the measured position. The latter could be noisy so it's more stable to use the former.

    <p>
      If actual positions were used instead, even in simulation, we'd get a good solution but then in the <i>null space</i> (in the multiple solution dimension) the elbow will walk around a little. It's a subtlety of the way these things feedback with the numerical precision of the integrator.
    </p>

    <li>commanded desired spatial velocities $V^{G^d}$</li>
  </ul>

  PIC takes in commanded poses and outputs commanded joint positions (integrator included). The manipulation station takes in desired position commands (not velocities), so we need an integration step to turn desired velocities into position commands. The initial conditions of the integrator need to match that of the robot, else the robot will go to a very bad initial condition at time zero. 

  <p>
    The manipulation station outputs the actual/measured iiwa positions. The trajectory generator converts the planned sketch into a spatial velocity trajectory. It feed into the PIC, which feeds into the integrator which feeds the manipualtion station.

<section id="1"><h1>Limitations</h1>
  The chapter's notebook has sliders that rotates the joints of the arm which then changes the Jacobian, which is printed.

  <p>
    If there are no solutions, the controller will come up with the best possible solution. It will find the minimum norm. When is it not enough? At a singularity. What does a singularity mean? 
  </p>

  <button class="accordion">Matrix rank</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p></p>
    The <i>rank of a matrix</i> is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in that matrix. In robotics, the <i>rank of a matrix</i> is used to determine the <i>manipulability</i> or <i>controllability</i> of a robot arm. It indicates the number of independent directions in which the end-effector of the arm can move. The <i>rank of the Jacobian matrix</i>, which relates the joint velocities to the end-effector velocities, provides valuable information about the arm's mobility and its ability to reach different positions and orientations in its workspace.

    <p>
      If the rank of the Jacobian matrix is equal to the number of DOF of the robot arm, it means that the arm can move freely in all possible directions within its workspace. This implies that the robot arm is fully controllable and can reach any desired position and orientation within its reachable workspace.
    </p>
    
    On the other hand, if the rank of the Jacobian matrix is less than the number of DOF, it suggests that the arm is kinematically constrained. This can occur when certain joints of the arm are mechanically linked or when there are other physical limitations that restrict the arm's movement. In such cases, the arm may have limited mobility and may not be able to reach all desired positions and orientations in its workspace.

    <p>
      In summary, the rank of a matrix, particularly the Jacobian matrix, provides insight into the controllability and mobility of a robot arm. A higher rank indicates greater freedom of movement, while a lower rank suggests constraints or limitations on the arm's motion.
    </p>
  </div>

  When the arm changes from having good solutions to having no or infinite solutions, there is the possibility of the rank of the matrix $[J^B(q)]^{-1}_{\scriptscriptstyle{6\times{7}}}$ to drop. Since we are trying to find $q$, we only care about the row rank. It is a good case, when we have 7 $\dot{q}$s and only 6 desired velocities, since we have multiple solutions. We never want the rank to drop below 6.

  <p>
    A robot will break before it drops rank. What actually happens is, as the robot approaches losing rank the inverse gets poorly conditioned and we'll get very big commanded velocities out which will cause the robot to hit a joint or velocity limit and it'll shut down.
  </p>

  The relative distance (numerically) between the smallest and largest singular value is not what matters. If the smallest singular value gets close to 0, we'd get large velocities on inverting the matrix. So it's useful to plot the smallest singular value. 
  
  <p>
    One easy way to get the arm in a singular state is to straighten it. There could be other singularities. When an arm is pretty extended and we try to extend it more, things are going to get bad.
