<section id="0"><h1>Computing the pose of the EE using FK</h1>
  Given that we've set all the joint angles:
  <ul>
    <li>Compute pose of the EE relative to the wrist</li>
    We find the rotation matrix for the rotation joint which is just a relative pose.

    <p>
      <li>Chain it backwards all the way to the world coordinates</li>
    </p>
  </ul>

  The math is simple because each individual joint is just describing a small rotation matrix kind of operation on a relative transform from right before the robot's joint until right after the robot's joint. That's how robots are specified in robot description files as relative poses of each link - 6 numbers: x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw. Joints are just operations that will make a transformation from the pre joint frame to the post-joint frame. 

</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Defining $q$</h1>
  <p>
    $q$ should be defined in such a way so as to be sufficient to tell us where all the attached bodies are in the world. In iiwa that's bolted down, all we need are 7 numbers of the different rotations of the different joints. But if we have a red brick on the table, we need enough something in $q$ to be able to eventually pull out the pose. 
  </p>

  In code, we define a $3\times 3$ rotation matrix for each joint based on the corresponding joint angle. We can then go through a series of frame transformations (through all the joints) to get the full kinematics. 
  <ul>
    <li>Iiwa</li>
    In iiwa, it's a $7\times 1$ vector of rotational joint angles representing the revolute joints. It's 7 because we choose to use quaternions in the coordinate representation to avoid gimbal locks and singularities.

    <p>
      <li>Allegro hand</li>
      It has 4 fingers with 4 links per finger. Total number of joint angles is 16. Plus, 7 numbers to configure its position in space. 
    </p>

    <li>Allegro hand picking up a brick</li>
    23 numbers for the hand and 7 for the brick. The kinematics problem then becomes going from the 30 numbers (representing q) to some pose of the brick and hand.
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Drake implementation</h1>
  To compute the FK in drake, we need to specify the frames to get the pose of the desired frame relative to some other frame expressed in some other frame.

  <p>
    The context is taken as the argument instead of $q$ because the kinematics can be parameterized. If we were designing a robot and we wanted to optimise the length of a link for instance. Then we'd like the kinematics to also be a function of the link lengths or some other quantities. Hence, this is useful.
  </p>

  The <i>context</i> is just state + parameters + time; it's just the structure that wraps it. 

  <p>
    Very often, quaternions is used to represent the position/orientation and rotation matrix is used to represent the pose $X$.
