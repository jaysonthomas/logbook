<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Commonality: Covariance</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Mathematical model of noise</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A <i>noise distribution</i> captures the imperfections in a sensor, by modeling the likelihood of making measurement $z$ given the system is in state $x$, $p(z|x)$.</li>
    It is not possible to know exactly how much noise gets added to each individual measurement. However, the distribution from which the noise is sampled can be modeled.

    <p>
      <li>Noise distributions are often modeled as a zero-mean gaussian with some covariance $R$.</li>

      To each measurement, a noise $v$ is added, sampled from the gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0, R)$. The most likely measurement is centred on the true value of whatever the sensor measures with some covariance.

      $$
        v \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R)
      $$
    </p>
  </ul>

  <subsection id="0.0"><h1>Measurement noise covariance</h1>
    <subsubsection><h1>Purpose</h1>
      It influences how much trust should be placed on measurements. Higher values in $R$ indicate higher measurement noise, which means less trust in measurements and more reliance on the <n>model prediction</n>.
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection><h1>Computation</h1>
      $R$ is usually specified based on known characteristics of measurement sensors or systems. It is often assumed to be constant or known a priori
    </subsubsection>
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Estimation covariance</h1>
  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>Purpose</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The estimation covariance matrix $P$ represents the uncertainty in the estimated state variables.</li>
      
      It quantifies how much the estimated state variables are expected to vary from their <m>true values</m> due to <m>uncertainties in the system model</m> and the measurements.

      <p>
        <li>It helps in determining how much weight should be given to new measurements versus the current state estimate.</li>
        
        A larger $P$ means higher uncertainty in the current state estimate, which results in giving more weight to new measurements.
      </p>  
    </ul>
     

  </subsection>
  <subsection id="1.1"><h1>Computation</h1>
    In Kalman filter, $P$ is updated recursively based on the process model (model prediction) and the measurement update, to give an overall uncertainty of the state estimate.
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>When Estimation and Measurement noise covariance becomes equal</h1>
  <subsubsection><h1>Initial conditions</h1>
    At the initial time step, if the initial state estimate is set to be the same as the measurement, then $P$ might initially be equal to $R$. However, as the estimation process proceeds, $P$ will diverge due to the incorporation of <m>process dynamics</m>.
  </subsubsection>

  <subsubsection><h1>Simple systems</h1>
    In some simplified systems where the model is straightforward and the process noise is negligible, $P$ might be driven primarily by the measurement noise. Even in such cases, $P$ would not be exactly equal to $R$ but could be influenced by it significantly.
  </subsubsection>

  <subsubsection><h1>Steady-state conditions</h1>
    In some steady-state conditions of a linear system with constant noise characteristics, the asymptotic behavior of $P$ might lead it to a value that reflects the steady-state influence of $R$. Even then, $P$ is not equal to $R$ but is influenced by $R$.
