<section id="0"><h1>Overall idea of LS</h1>
  Carl Friedrich Gauss' description of <code>Least Squares</code>:
  <blockquote>
    The most probable value of an unknown parameter is that which minimizes the sum of squared errors between the observed and the expected, multiplied by numbers that measure the degree of precision (weights or uncertainties associated with each observation).
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The least squares method aims to fit a mathematical model to a set of observed data points. Each data point has an associated uncertainty or error (<i>weight</i>), which represents how much that specific observation can deviate from the true value. 
  </p>
  
  Gauss was suggesting that to find the most probable value of an unknown parameter, one should consider
  <ul>
    <li>The squared differences between the model's predictions and the observed data points</li>
    <li>The uncertainties associated with each data point</li>
  </ul>
  
  Multiplying the squared error by weights gives more importance to data points with lower uncertainty. This way the overall error is getting minimised whilst also taking into account the quality or reliability of each data point.

  <p>
    A weight can be thought of as the inverse of the variance (or standard deviation) associated with each data point. Data points with smaller variances (higher precision) contribute more to the parameter estimation in the least squares method. 
  </p>

  Getting the model right is hard! <m>Do we take the square root of the mean of the sum of squared errors?</m>

<section id="1"><h1>Assumptions in LS</h1>
  Things to keep in mind when making a measurement:
  <ul>
    <li>Sampling time</li>
    <li>Measurement model</li>
    <li>State of the system at the time of the measurement</li>
    <li>Accuracy of the measurements</li>
  </ul>

  The most basic least squares approach would make the following unrealistic assumptions:

  <ul>
    <li>The measurements come in all at once</li>
    <li>The underlying measurement model $H$ is noisy but linear</li>
    Measurements of things like orientation are rarely linear.
    <li>The vehicle is stationary</li>
    <li>Each measurement has an equal weight in the error equation</li>
    We care about each of the measurements equally.
  </ul>
