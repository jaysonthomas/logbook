<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>RLS: Kalman Gain</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Relationship with estimate error covariance</h1>
  Kalman filter's state estimation process updates two key things at every time step:
  <ul>
    <li>The state estimate (the filter's best guess of the current state).</li>
    <li>The covariance of the estimate (which represents the uncertainty in the state estimate).</li>
  </ul>

  When $K$ is large, the filter places more weight on the measurements (i.e., it's more confident in the measurements compared to the prediction). After the state is updated, the estimate covariance matrix is updated as follows:

  $$
    P_k = (I-K_kH_k)P_{k-1}
  $$

  <div style="width:0; text-align:left;">
    $$\begin{array}{ccl} 
      P_k &:& \text{Updated (posterior) state covariance matrix after incorporating the measurement at time $k$} \\ 
      P_{k-1} &:& \text{Predicted (prior) covariance matrix before incorporating the measurement} \\
      K_k &:& \text{Kalman gain matrix at time $k$} \\
      H &:& \text{Observation matrix (relates the state to the measurements)} \\
      I &:& \text{Identity matrix}
    \end{array}$$
  </div>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Impact of larger kalman gain</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>When $K_k$ is larger, the product $(I-K_kH_k)$ decreases the predicted covariance $P_k$ more significantly.</li>
    <li>This reduction reflects the fact that the new measurement has provided more useful information, allowing the filter to decrease the uncertainty in its estimate.</li>
  </ul>

  Thus, the larger the Kalman gain, the smaller the updated (posterior) covariance, indicating that the filter is more confident in the updated estimate.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Interpretation of Covariance Reduction</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A smaller posterior covariance means the filter's confidence in its new state estimate has increased, and the estimate is considered more accurate.</li>

    <li>The magnitude of this reduction depends on the relative uncertainties of the model prediction and the measurement. If the Kalman gain is large, it implies that the measurement provides valuable information, which justifies reducing the covariance.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Relation with measurement noise</h1>
  When $R$ is large, the measurement is considered noisy, so $K$ becomes smaller, meaning the filter places less weight on the measurement. $R$ affects the Kalman filter indirectly through $K$ which is computed before updating the estimate covariance.
  $$
    K_k = P_{k-1}H^T_k(H_kP_{k-1}H^T_k + R_k)^{-1}
  $$

  <subsection id="3.0"><h1>Updates</h1>
    If characteristics of the measurement noise are unknown at the start, $R$ may be initialised to a large value to reflect high uncertainty about the reliability of the measurements.

    <p>
      By default, standard Kalman filters do not update $R$ because it is assumed to represent the measurement noise characteristics, which are considered fixed for a given sensor or system.
    </p>

    However, in some scenarios, $R$ might be updated dynamically:
    <subsubsection><h1>Residual covariance</h1>
      Here, $R$ (and sometimes the process noise covariance $Q$)is adjusted based on observed data, such as the residuals (differences between predicted and measured values). One common approach is to compute $R$ from the covariance of the residuals.

      $$
        R \approx Cov(y_k - H_k\hat{x}_{k-1})
      $$
    </subsubsection>
    <subsubsection><h1>Time-varying measurement noise</h1>
      In some applications, the measurement noise characteristics change over time (e.g., environmental factors affecting sensor performance). In these cases:

      <ul>
        <li>$R$ might be updated dynamically based on external information (e.g., sensor diagnostics or environmental monitoring).</li>
        <li>Example: A radar system might adjust $R$ based on the distance to the target, as measurement noise could increase with range.</li>
      </ul>
