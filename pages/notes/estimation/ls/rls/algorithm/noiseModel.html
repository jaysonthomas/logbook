<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Noise model</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A <i>noise distribution</i> captures the imperfections in a sensor, by modeling the likelihood of making measurement $y$ given the system is in state $x$, $p(y|x)$.</li>
    It is not possible to know exactly how much noise gets added to each individual measurement. However, the distribution from which the noise is sampled can be modeled.

    <p>
      <li>Noise distributions are often modeled as a zero-mean gaussian with some covariance $R$.</li>

      To each measurement, a noise $v$ is added, sampled from the gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0, R)$. The most likely measurement is centred on the true value of whatever the sensor measures with some covariance.

      $$
        v \sim \mathcal{N}(0, R)
      $$
    </p>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Measurement noise covariance</h1>
  <subsubsection><h1>Purpose</h1>
    It influences how much trust should be placed on measurements. Higher values in $R$ indicate higher measurement noise, which means less trust in measurements and more reliance on the <n>model prediction</n>.
  </subsubsection>
  <subsubsection><h1>Computation</h1>
    $R$ is usually specified based on known characteristics of measurement sensors or systems. It is often assumed to be constant or known a priori
  </subsubsection>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Covariance values</h1>
  If characteristics of the measurement noise are unknown at the start, $R$ may be initialised to a large value to reflect high uncertainty about the reliability of the measurements.

  <p>
    By default, standard Kalman filters do not update $R$ because it is assumed to represent the measurement noise characteristics, which are considered fixed for a given sensor or system.
  </p>

  However, in some scenarios, $R$ might be updated dynamically:
  <subsubsection><h1>Residual covariance</h1>
    Here, $R$ (and sometimes the process noise covariance $Q$) is adjusted based on observed data, such as the residuals (differences between predicted and measured values). One common approach is to compute $R$ from the <m>covariance of the residuals</m>.

    $$
      R \approx Cov(y_k - H_k\hat{x}_{k-1})
    $$
  </subsubsection>

  <subsubsection><h1>Time-varying measurement noise</h1>
    In some applications, the measurement noise characteristics change over time (e.g., environmental factors affecting sensor performance). In these cases:

    <ul>
      <li>$R$ might be updated dynamically based on external information (e.g., sensor diagnostics or environmental monitoring).</li>
      <li>Example: A radar system might adjust $R$ based on the distance to the target, as measurement noise could increase with range.</li>
    </ul>
