<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 1"><h1>Smart pointers</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  When a smart pointer is no longer needed (which is the case as soon as it goes out of scope), the memory to which it points is automatically deallocated. In essence, smart pointers are classes wrapped around raw pointers. By overloading the <code>-></code> and <code>*</code> operators, it is possible to use smart pointers with the same syntax as raw pointers. The technique of wrapping a management class around a resource that smart pointers build on is called <i>RAII</i>. 

  <p>
    With smart pointers, resource acquisition occurs at the same time that the object is initialised. In modern C++, raw pointers managed with new and delete should only be used in small blocks of code with limited scope, where performance is critical (such as with placement new) and ownership rights of the memory resource are clear.
  </p>

  A smart pointer is a class template that is declared on the stack. During its initialisation, the raw pointer within it, gets allocated the necessary heap memory. This memory gets deleted as soon as the smart pointer goes out of scope. Smart pointers need to be declared on the stack, else the scoping mechanism would not work.

  <p>
    The destructor of a smart pointer contains a call to <code>delete</code>, and because a smart pointer is declared on the stack, its destructor is invoked as soon as it goes out of scope, even if an exception is thrown.

  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Conversion between pointers</h1>
  <a href="../../jlib/cppExamples/fundamentals/24_pointer_conversion.cpp">Example</a><br>
  
  In (1), a conversion from unique pointer to shared pointer is performed. You can see that this can be achieved by using std::move, which calls the move assignment operator on sharedPtr1 and steals the resource from uniquePtr while at the same time invalidating its resource handle on the heap-allocated integer.

  <p>
    In (2), you can see how to convert from weak to shared pointer. Imagine that you have been passed a weak pointer to a memory object which you want to work on. To avoid invalid memory access, you want to make sure that the object will not be deallocated before your work on it has been finished. To do this, you can convert a weak pointer to a shared pointer by calling the lock() function on the weak pointer.
  </p>

  In (3), a raw pointer is extracted from a shared pointer. However, this operation does not decrease the reference count within sharedPtr2. This means that calling delete on rawPtr in the last line before main returns will generate a runtime error as a resource is trying to be deleted which is managed by sharedPtr2 and has already been removed. The output of the program when compiled with g++ thus is: malloc: *** error for object 0x1003001f0: pointer being freed was not allocated.

  <p>
    Note that there are no options for converting away from a shared pointer. Once you have created a shared pointer, you must stick to it (or a copy of it) for the remainder of your program.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Transferring ownership</h1>
  In other words, when (and when not) to use smart pointers and how to properly pass them between functions. The following list contains all the variations (omitting const) of passing an object to a function:

<pre><code class="c++">
void f( object* );              // a
void f( object& );              // b
void f( unique_ptr&ltobject&gt );   // c
void f( unique_ptr&ltobject&gt& );  // d
void f( shared_ptr&ltobject&gt );   // e
void f( shared_ptr&ltobject&gt& );  // f
</code></pre>

  <subsection id="3.0"><h1>The preferred way</h1>
    The preferred way of to pass object parameters is by using a or b. In doing so, we do not have to worry about the lifetime policy a caller might have implemented. Using a specific smart pointer in a case where we only want to observe an object or manipulate a member might be overly restrictive.

    <p>
      With the non-owning raw pointer * or the reference & we can observe an object from which we can assume that its lifetime will exceed the lifetime of the function parameter. In concurrency however, this might not be the case, but for linear code we can safely assume this.
    </p>
    To decide wether a * or & is more appropriate, you should think about wether you need to express that there is no object. This can only be done with pointers by passing e.g. nullptr. In most other cases, you should use a reference instead.    
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="3.1"><h1>The object sink</h1>
    The preferred way of passing an object to a function so that the function takes ownership of the object (or „consumes“ it) is by using method c.

    <p>
      In this case, we are passing a unique pointer by value from caller to function, which then takes ownership of the the pointer and the underlying object. This is only possible using move semantics as there may be only a single reference to the object managed by the unique pointer.
    </p>

    After the object has been passed in this way, the caller will have an invalid unique pointer and the function to which the object now belongs may destroy it or move it somewhere else. Using const with this particular call does not make sense as it models an ownership transfer so the source will be definitely modified.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="3.2"><h1>In and out again</h1>
    In some cases, we want to modify a unique pointer (not necessarily the underlying object) and re-use it in the context of the caller. In this case, method d would be most suitable.

    <p>
      Using this call structure, the function states that it might modify the smart pointer, e.g. by redirecting it to another object. It is not recommended to use it for accepting an object only because we should avoid restricting ourselves unnecessarily to a particular object lifetime strategy on the caller side.
    </p>

    Using const with this call structure is not recommendable as we would not be able to modify the unique_ptr in this case. In case you want to modify the underlying object, use method a instead.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="3.3"><h1>Sharing object ownership</h1>
    In the last examples, we have looked at strategies involving unique ownership. In this example, we want to express that a function will store and share ownership of an object on the heap. This can be achieved by using method e.

    <p>
      In this example, we are making a copy of the shared pointer passed to the function. In doing so, the internal reference counter within all shared pointers referring to the same heap object is incremented by one. This strategy can be recommended for cases where the function needs to retain a copy of the shared_ptr and thus share ownership of the object. This is of interest when we need access to smart pointer functions such as the reference count or we must make sure that the object to which the shared pointer refers is not prematurely deallocated (which might happen in concurrent programming).
    </p>

    If the local scope of the function is not the final destination, a shared pointer can also be moved, which does not increase the reference count and is thus more effective.

    <p>
      A disadvantage of using a shared_ptr as a function argument is that the function will be limited to using only objects that are managed by shared pointers - which limits flexibility and reusability of the code.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="3.4"><h1>In And Out Again</h1>
    As with unique pointers, the need to modify shared pointers and re-use them in the context of the caller might arise. In this case, method f might be the right choice.

    <p>
      This particular way of passing a shared pointer expresses that the function f will modify the pointer itself. As with method e), we will be limiting the usability of the function to cases where the object is managed by a shared_ptr and nothing else.
