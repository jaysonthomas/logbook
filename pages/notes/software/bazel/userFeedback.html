  Good to use with a project that has multiple coding languages - 
  C++, Java, Python, Nodejs, Rust etc. Used with tensor flow. Google supports it.
  Download a binary release from <a href="https://t.ly/dn7z9">here</a> - bazelisk-linux-amd64.

  Follow <a href="https://bit.ly/3FOlrhA">these instructions</a> to install 
  bazel using apt. <a href="https://t.ly/04QTG">Good C++</a> tutorial.
  Checkout the concepts section as well.

<section id="1"><h1>Reddit user's view on Bazel vs cmake</h1>
  We have recently migrated multiple CMake projects to Bazel and am very happy 
  with the result.
  
  <p>
    Bazel is a better and more powerful build system overall, is more hermetic, 
    has stronger support for accurate caching and parallel execution, 
    including remote caching and remote execution, and caching and parallel/remote 
    execution of tests, doing code generation directly in the build (eg protobuf), 
    can produce docker images directly, and excels at integrating multiple 
    languages together into the same build and at integration testing. 
    And the build language is a straightforward limited version of Python. 
    You can include multiple different configurations and toolchains in the 
    same build as well.
  </p>
  
  Broadly I find Bazel does things "more correctly" even if it is harder to get 
  started with, and it works great with lots of languages as well.

  <p>
    CMake is a simpler, less featureful build system that is more broadly used with an 
    objectively worse configuration language, but more people know it, 
    it has easier access to libraries and works with more IDEs.
  </p>
  
  Personally I either found Bazel builds of all the libraries I needed or they were 
  trivial enough to include with http_archive and BUILD file containing a 
  simple cc_library target. There is also rules_foreign_cc that allows 
  you to delegate to the CMake build of an external library.

  <p>
    Both build systems are full of their own annoyances, but Bazel is more general, 
    more powerful, more forward looking and gets the fundamentals right.
    Another thing thatâ€™s nice about Bazel is with --disk_cache it will remember 
    all previous build and test results instead of just the most recent one, 
    so you can switch back and forth between branches without needing to rebuild and retest.
  </p>
