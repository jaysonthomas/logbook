<section id="0"><h1>Diagram Builder</h1>
  The real modeling power of Drake comes from combining many smaller systems together into more complex systems. We use the <code>DiagramBuilder</code> class to <code>AddSystem()</code>s and to <code>Connect()</code> input ports to output ports or to expose them as inputs/output of the diagram.  Then we call <code>Build()</code> to generate the new <i>Diagram</i> instance, which is just another System in the framework, and can be simulated or analyzed using the entire suite of tools.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Scenegraph</h1>
  <code>class 'pydrake.geometry.SceneGraph'</code>.
  The <i>scenegraph</i> defines relationships between 3D objects and each of their spatial properties.

  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>Implementation details</h1>
    It is a data structure that represents a hierarchical organization of objects in a 3D world using nodes and edges.

    <ul>
      <li><i>Nodes</i> represent objects in the scene, such as a robot or a table</li>
      <li><i>Edges</i> represent the spatial relationships between the objects, such as parent-child relationships or constraints</li>
      <p>
        <li><i>Node properties</i></li>
        Each node can have a set of properties associated with it, such as its geometry (position, orientation, and scale), material properties, and physical properties. These properties can be used to simulate the dynamics of the objects in the scene, such as their collisions and interactions with each other.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Relationship between Plant and Scenegraph</h1>

  In Drake, the SceneGraph manages the geometric representation of a system, while the Plant manages its physical dynamics.

  <p>
    The SceneGraph system contains information about the geometry of a system, such as the location, size, and shape of objects. It also provides methods for querying the geometric properties of objects in the scene, such as their positions, orientations, and velocities. These queries are performed using the <code>geometry_query</code> object.
  </p>
  
  The Plant system, on the other hand, is responsible for modeling the dynamics of a system. It contains information about the physical properties of objects, such as their masses, moments of inertia, and contact models.

  <p>
    To connect these two systems, the Plant system receives geometric information from the SceneGraph through the geometry_query object. The Plant system uses this information to compute the physical properties/dynamics of objects, such as their positions, velocities, and forces.
  </p>
  
  For example, suppose we have a rigid body in the Plant system that is connected to a visual geometry in the SceneGraph. To compute the forces acting on the rigid body, the Plant system might first request information about the position and orientation of the visual geometry using the geometry_query object. It can then use this information to compute the forces acting on the rigid body due to interactions with other objects in the scene.
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Plant</h1>
  [<a href="https://t.ly/YM78">Ref</a>], [<a href="https://bit.ly/3M97DTo">Finalize ref</a>].
  <code>class 'pydrake.multibody.plant.MultibodyPlant'</code>.
  A <i>plant</i> refers to a physical system that can be modeled using differential equations. This could be a mechanical system such as a robot or a physical process such as a chemical reaction or a fluid flow.

  <p>
    Each plant in Drake has a <n>set of inputs and outputs</n>, which represent the external forces or signals that affect the plant and the output of the plant's behavior, respectively. The plant's behavior is defined by a set of differential equations that describe how the <n>plant's state</n> changes over time in response to its inputs.
  </p>
  Plants in Drake are represented using a unified interface, which allows them to be easily composed and interconnected.  Drake also provides a library of pre-built plants that can be used to model a wide range of physical systems. Additionally, users can create their own custom plants by implementing the necessary interface functions and providing the relevant differential equations.

  <p>

  </p>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Parser</h1>
  In Drake, a <i>parser</i> is a tool that reads and interprets files or data in a specific format (URDF, SDF, STL, and OBJ) and converts it into an internal data structure (an internal representation of the objects and their properties) that can be used by other parts of the system (example, it can be used to create a scenegraph or a physical model of a robot or other object).

  <p>
    Parsers are often used as part of the process of creating or configuring a simulation or control system. For example, a user might create a robot model in URDF format, and then use the URDF parser in Drake to create a physical model of the robot that can be used for simulation or control.
  </p>
  Drake also allows users to create their own custom parsers for reading data in other formats. 
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>Package map</h1>
  Drake uses a package-based approach to organizing its code and resources, where each package corresponds to a collection of related code and data files. The PackageMap provides a way to map the logical names of these packages to their physical locations on the file system, which allows the system to locate and load the files as needed.

  <p>
    <code>package://</code> is a URI scheme that is used to reference files located within a package. For example, if a package is named 'my_package', then a file located within that package could be referenced using the URI <code>package://my_package/path/to/file</code>.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="6"><h1>Leaf system</h1>
  <i>Leaf systems</i> are the smallest building blocks in Drake and can be combined to create more complex systems. A leaf system represents a single:
  <ul>
    <li>Physical component - spring, damper, sensor or a RigidBodyPlant or</li> 
    <li>Mathematical component - functions such as Adder, Multiplier, and TrigExp</li>
  </ul>
  They are often implemented as C++ classes that inherit from the LeafSystem base class.

  Leaf systems in Drake have well-defined inputs and outputs, which can be either continuous signals, such as position or velocity, or discrete events, such as button presses or sensor readings.
</section>

<section id="7"><h1>DeclareForcedPublishEvent</h1>
  [<a href="https://bit.ly/3TPAuxX">Ref</a>] This could be the first Drake function in C++ that I try to understand. In short, the function must be called with a callback or a handler as the argument. The callback function must be a function within a class that is derived from <code>LeafSystem</code> and takes <code>context</code> as its argument.
</section>

<section id="8"><h1>Simulation description format (SDF)</h1>
  <subsection id="8.0"><h1>Moment of inertia</h1>
  <i>ixx</i> refers to the moment of inertia of a 3D object along the x-axis. The <i>moment of inertia</i> is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion about an axis, and it depends on the object's mass distribution and shape. 
  
  <p> 
    <i>ixy</i> refers to the <i>product of inertia</i> between the x and y axes of a 3D object; which is a measure of the distribution of mass around the object's centroid, and it determines how the object will rotate when forces are applied in different directions.
  </p>
  
  The moment of inertia components "ixx", "iyy", and "izz" and the product of inertia components "ixy", "iyz", and "ixz" are used to construct the full <i>inertia tensor</i>, which fully describes an object's moment of inertia.

  <p>
    In the SDF file format, the "ixx" value is typically specified for each link or collision element and is used by physics engines to simulate the object's behavior in response to external forces and torques.
