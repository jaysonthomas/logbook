<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 1"><h1>RAII</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  <i>Resource Acquisition Is Initialisation</i>. The goal is to have allocation and deallocation disappear from the surface level of the code thereby protecting resources such as a file stream, a network connection or a block of memory. This is <n>achieved by</n>:
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Wrapping a management class around a resource (the resource is entirely managed within the class) while providing third-party access through well-defined interfaces only
    </li>
    <li>Smart pointers</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>The main advantages</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Manages ownership</li>
    <li>Manages lifetime of dynamically allocated objects since class destructors perform resource clean-up tasks when the RAII object gets out of scope. This also leads to better abstraction since details around resource acquisition and release is hidden.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Examples of acquiring and releasing resources</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Allocate/free memory</li>
    <li>Open/close a file or network connection</li>
    <li>Protect synchronisation primitives such as atomic operations, memory barriers, monitors or critical sections, which must be released to allow other threads to obtain them</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Problems that RAII tries to solve</h1>
  Dynamically allocated memory on the heap using malloc/free or new/delete is extremely powerful, as it allows for fine-grained control over precious memory resource. However, the correct use of these concepts requires some degree of skill, experience and concentration from the programer. The aspects that hold for new/delete as described below also apply to malloc/free; it applies to any kind of resource management.

  <ul>
    <li>Pairing</li>
    Every dynamically allocated object that is created with <code>new</code> must be followed by a manual deallocation. If <code>delete</code> is not called <m>or if it is done at an inappropriate position in the code</m>, memory leaks will occur which might clog up a large portion of memory. There might be several points where the resource could potentially be released, making it hard to keep track of all eventualities

    <p>
      <li>Correct operator pairing</li>
      A dynamically allocated <n>array</n> initialised with <code>new[]</code> may only be deleted with the operator <code>delete[]</code>. If the wrong operator is used, the program behaviour will be undefined.
    </p>

    <li>Exceptions</li>
    The program might throw an exception during resource use and thus the point of release might never be reached.

    <p>
      <li>Memory ownership</li>
      If a third-party function returns a pointer to a data structure, the only way of knowing who is responsible for resource deallocation is by looking into either the code or the documentation. If both are not available (as is often the case), there is no way to infer the ownership from the return type. If for some reason the programer does not know this, he or she might call delete and thus interfere with the inner workings of the library.
    </p>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>RAII management class</h1>
  There are 3 parts to an RAII class:
  <ul>
    <li>A resource is allocated in the constructor</li>
    <li>A resource is de-allocated in the destructor</li>
    <li>All instances of the RAII class are allocated on the stack to reliably control the lifetime via the object scope</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Example of an RAII class</h1>
  <a href="../../jlib/cppExamples/fundamentals/20_raii.cpp">Code</a>

  <subsection id="4.0"><h1>Resource allocation/deallocation</h1>
    In the example code, the resource allocation takes place in 2 steps:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>new int(i)</code> creates a new block of memory on the heap and initialises it with the value of <code>i</code>. <n>It returns the address of the block of memory</n>.
      </li>
      <p>
        <li>
          <code>MyInt en(…)</code> creates an object of class <code>MyInt</code> on the stack, which internally creates an integer on the heap. The constructor of class <code>MyInt</code> gets called with the address of a valid heap memory block as a parameter.
        </li>
      </p>    
    </ul>

    Because the <code>MyInt</code> object <code>en</code> lives on the stack, it is automatically deallocated after each loop cycle - which automatically calls the destructor (which in turn calls <code>delete</code>) to release the heap memory.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="4.1"><h1>Resource utilisation</h1>
<pre><code class="cpp">
int& operator*() 
{ 
  return *_p; 
}  
</code></pre>

    The dereference operator is overloaded allowing it to be used in the same manner as with raw pointers to retrieve the value to which the internal raw pointer is pointing. 

    <p>
      Using <code>int&</code> along with returning <code>*_p</code>, the function returns the address of the value the pointer is pointing to. <m>Return by reference as <a href="../../jlib/cppExamples/fundamentals/25_returnByRef.cpp">here</a> is still a mystery</m>.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="4.2"><h1>How not to do it</h1>
    In <a href="../../jlib/cppExamples/fundamentals/20b_raii.cpp">Example 2</a>, the destructor of <code>MyInt</code> would never be called, hence causing a memory leak with each loop iteration.
