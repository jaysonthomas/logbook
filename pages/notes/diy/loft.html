  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>Cross-beaming</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Not sure about the weight the ceiling joists can hold. Look for cut roofs in google images.
      </li>

      <p>
        <li>Two types of roofs - trussed vs cut roof. Ours seems to be a cut roof.</li>
      </p>
  
      <li>
        Can ceiling joists (or battens) be used as floor joists: <a href="https://t.ly/y7Cwl">Ref</a>.
      </li>

      <p>
        <li>
          Some people place 8x2 timbers along side the old 4x2 ceiling joists.
        </li>
      </p>

      <li>2 inch twin thread screws with 38 x 63 x 2400mm timber. Studwork timber is typically available in standardized sizes. Common sizes in the UK include 38mm x 63mm (often referred to as 2x3) and 38mm x 89mm (often referred to as 2x4). </li>

      <p>
        <li>
          If there is a supporting wall in the centre, we can build on top of this with 3 x 2 spacer, andl lay 4  x 2 joists on top of the spacer, overlapping on the supporting walls. But i don't know what to attach the othe end to as they go towards the eaves?
          I was thinking of suspending timber bolted to the rafters, and attaching the joists to the bottom of these timbers once they've been ensured to be level? Exactly what we do when there is no supporting joists, usually towards the gable ends, we just screw cls across and this usually does the trick.

<section id="2"><h1>Loft insulation</h1>
  <a href="https://t.ly/u8q8">Ref</a> - this gives me the overall process. I need
  270mm of insulation below the loft floor.
  
  <subsection id="2.0"><h1>Laying the insulation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Insulation should be level with the joists</li>
      Leave a 25mm gap around the bottom of the rafters for ventilation.
      Do not squash the insulation into place, as this reduces the 
      material's ability to insulate.

      <p>
      <li>Wires should go over the insulation</li>
      Recessed light covers (also called <i>downlight loft caps</i>) should be 
      used wherever necessary to prevent a potential fire hazard.
      </p>
    </ul>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="2.1"><h1>Materials</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Knauf insulation Eko roll</li>
      (L)7.28m (W)1.14m (T)100mm. The material is glass mineral wool. 
      Coverage area is 8.3$m^2$. The thermal resistance or R-value
      is 2.25$m^2K/W$.

<section id="3"><h1>Loft ceiling</h1>
  <subsection id="3.0"><h1>Lath and plaster</h1>
    It is a building process used to finish mainly interior dividing walls and ceilings.
    It consists of narrow strips of wood (<code>laths</code>) which are nailed horizontally 
    across the wall studs or ceiling joists and then coated in plaster.

<section id="5"><h1>Steps</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Measure loft hatch</li>
    <li>Decide on loft board</li>
    [<a href="https://t.ly/wJ7kO">Ref</a>] Standard sizes are $2400 x 600$mm and $1220 x 320$mm, both of which are $18$mm thick.

    <p>
      Could be <a href="https://t.ly/8ftyK">the one</a>.
    </p>

    <li>Attach extra insulation layers to the floor or the roof?</li>
    <li>Measure loft area</li>
    <li>Decide on loft entry ladder and where in the loft it would fold on to once closed</li>
    May have to go for a more sturdy timber ladder that allows frequent usage. Some ladders come with a loft hatch door so may have to widen the hatch.

    <p>
      <li>Noggins</li>
      For strengthening the joists. Apparently, if the joists are more than 2.6m, they need them.
    </p>

    <li>Measure the distance between the centres of each joist</li>
    If the distance $\leq 450$mm, use board of 18mm thickness. If distance $\geq 450$ and $\leq 600$, use 22 mm board.

    <p>
      <li>Plan the loft space</li>
      Create a 10mm gap between the rafters and the edges of the floor boards to allow for expansion. Try to plan for the gaps on either end of the floor space to be the same.
    </p>
  </ul>

<section id="6"><h1>Loft legs or timber joists</h1>
  <a href="https://t.ly/POh07">Someone online</a> has had $4'' \times 2''$ <i>ceiling joists</i> with $100mm$ of insulation. And laid $6'' \times 2''$ timbers on them to add extra $170mm$ of extra insulation. 
  <ul>
    <li>$6'' \times 2'' \; \text{nominally} := 150 \times 47mm$</li>
    The <i>finished</i> dimensions: $145 \times 45mm$

    <p>
      <li>$4'' \times 2'' \; \text{nominally} := 100 \times 47mm$</li>

<section id="7"><h1>Placing the first 100mm insulation</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Clean out attic space</li>
    There was another layer of roof felt like material from the inside that was used to act as wind shield (at least as soon as I removed it, I could feel a breeze). I removed this.

<section id="8"><h1>Random terms</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Gable wall</li>
    It's probably the wall with nothing on the other side of it. For a mid terrace house, no wall can be considered a gable wall.

    <p>
      <li>Extra floor joists</li>
      [<a href="https://t.ly/HEIS-">Ref1</a> (this might be more for a truss roof), <a href="https://t.ly/bNEop">Ref2</a>] <br>
      Support joists using a wall plate bolted to the wall or joist hangers. The joists will be $~25 mm$ above the existing ceiling joists, so that when they deflect, they don't affect the ceiling below. Space them out $~450mm$.
