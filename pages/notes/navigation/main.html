<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Navigation overview</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Definition</h1>
  Navigation refers to the broader process of guiding a robot from its current location to a specified goal location in its environment. It involves higher-level decision-making processes, such as path planning, localization, and map interpretation.

  A planner might not know the state of the world ahead of time. It might have to consider contingencies and take into account various uncertainities. The problem of navigation also involves mission level decisions like when to return to a particular location to recharge. 
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Higher level reasoning</h1>
  This involves executing a plan within a finite state machine.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Representation</h1>
  This involves representing the vehicle and the world appropriately.
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Mapping & Localisation</h1>
  This involves setting up a search space and then conducting a search through that space.
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Motion planning</h1>
  Motion planning is a specific component of navigation that is concerned with converting a high-level path plan into specific motor commands to get to a goal safely and efficiently. Mathematically, the aim is to convert an initial state into a goal state. 

  <subsection id="4.0"><h1>Path planning</h1>
    Assumption: The environment is mapped out. The bot is localised.
  
    <p>
      Path planning involves waypoint generation. This includes planning to avoid obstacles. The aim is to get to a goal, optimising for constraints such as time.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection id="4.1"><h1>Trajectory Generation</h1>
    Trajectory generation involves creating a sequence of target velocity, acceleration and jerk inputs that can then be turned into actuator commands by a lower level controller. The aim is to get from 1 way point to another. It involves optimising for:
    <ul>
      <li>Energy efficiency</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
      <li>
        Taking the smoothest path to reduce jerks or sharp curves to ensure comfort
      </li>
      <li>
        Physical constraints of the robot by accounting for its kinematics and dynamics; since a bot cannot move in arbitrary ways.
      </li>
    </ul>  
  </subsection>
</section>
  
<section id="5"><h1>Representation of the planning problem</h1>
  To represent the planning problem and define the search space, the following is required:

  <ul>
    <li>
      A set of all possible states in which a vehicle might find itself in the world - the state space.
    </li>
    <li>A start state and a goal state.</li>
    <li>
      The set of actions that allow a vehicle to move from one state to the next - the action space.
    </li>
    <li>
      A cost assigned to each possible action.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="6"><h1>Search 'state' space</h1>
  A motion path from start to goal could be done as a continuous curve. In this case, a vehicle would be confronted with infinitely many decisions/actions at any given time which would be hard to solve given constraints on time and computational resources.

  <p>
    The goal is not to find the perfect solution, but rather to come up with a reasonable solution in a reasonable amount of time. Choosing the right search space or the right representation is key to solving the problem as efficiently as possible.
  </p>

  The continuous curve problem is recast into a finite set of discrete states that the vehicle must pass through. The states are either defined in an even or uneven manner across the search state space:

    </figure>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="7"><h1>Action space</h1>
  This describes how the vehicle moves from state to state. The choice of state space and action space are closely connected. To each type of action, a cost is assigned which describes how desirable or easy actions are relative to one another.
