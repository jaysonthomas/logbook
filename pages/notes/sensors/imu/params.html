<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Common config parameters</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Sensitivity</h1>
  It configures the <i>Measurement Range</i> or <i>Full Scale Range</i> of the accelerometer, i.e. the range of forces the accelerometer can measure, say between -8g and +8g. If the device experiences a force greater than 8g (like a hard impact), the sensor will clip and not measure the excess. 
  
  <p>
    In physics, sensitivity usually refers to the smallest change a sensor can detect which differs from this definition.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Output data rate</h1>
  This is the speed at which the sensor samples acceleration and updates the data registers.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Resolution</h1>
  This is the scale factor that defines how to convert the raw digital numbers (LSBs) coming out of the sensor into real-world physical units.

  <p>
    4.096 LSB/mg means that for every 1 milli-g of acceleration, the digital output increases by approximately 4 counts. Example: If a sensor reads a raw value of 4096, that equals 1000 mg or 1g.
  </p>

  For a gyroscope, the unit would be LSB/dps (degrees per second).
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Bandwidth</h1>
  Accelerometers are sensitive to high frequency vibrations. An internal low pass filter cuts off frequencies that are too fast for the ODR to capture accurately. ODR/4 means the bandwidth is set to 25% of the ODR. 
  
  <p>
    Calculation: 50 Hz / 4 = 12.5 Hz. The sensor will filter out vibrations faster than 12.5 Hz.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Relationship between resolution and sensitivity</h1>
  Because the sensor has a fixed number of digital "steps" (bits) available, changing the Range (Sensitivity) forces the Resolution (Scale Factor) to change. They are inversely proportional.
  
  <p>
    If you increase the range (e.g., to 16g) to measure bigger impacts, you stretch your available bits over a wider area. Your resolution gets worse (fewer LSBs per mg).If you decrease the range (e.g., to 2g) to measure tiny movements, your resolution gets better (more LSBs per mg).
  </p>
  
  The Math behind your specific config:Your sensor (BMI323) uses a 16-bit ADC. This means it has $2^{16}$ (65,536) possible steps.Total Range: $\pm 8g$ is a total span of 16,000 mg.Available Steps: 65,536.Calculation: $65,536 \text{ steps} / 16,000 \text{ mg} \approx \mathbf{4.096 \text{ LSB/mg}}$.
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>Group delay</h1>
  In some cases, an accelerometer doesn't just output raw electricity; it processes the data first. It runs the signal through a Digital Low-Pass Filter to smooth out vibrations and noise. The filter needs to collect a few samples of data to "average" them out or perform mathematical smoothing.

  <p>
    Gathering and processing these samples takes time. That waiting period is the Group Delay.
  </p>

  When the cut-off frequency of the sensor is lower (say ODR/4, narrow bandwidth), it takes more time to process the signal to make it smooth (23.6 ms vs 11.8ms for ODR/2).
