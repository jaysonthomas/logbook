  Accelerometers don't measure acceleration. According to Newton's 2nd law:
  $$
    a = \frac{1}{m}F
  $$

  The acceleration on a given vehicle depends on computing the sum of all forces $F$ acting on the vehicle. Accelerometers don't measure total acceleration, but <i>specific acceleration</i> which is the acceleration caused by all the forces acting on a vehicle except for gravity.

        Accelerometer housing - the proof mass is calibrated to be at the centre when the net external vertical force acting on the housing is $0$

  </div>
  A simple accelerometer consists of a proof mass attached inside of some housing and constrained to only move vertically. The proof mass is attached between the top and bottom of the housing with 2 springs. An accelerometer measures the difference between the upwards force provided by the upper spring and the downwards force provided by the lower spring.

  $$
    F_{springs,net} = F_{s,up} - F_{s,down}
  $$

  When an accelerometer is sitting on a table, the proof mass should have $0$ acceleration, because the housing has $0$ acceleration. To achieve this, the net force from the springs on the accelerometer is upwards and equal to $mg$ - the accelerometer would measure a net acceleration upwards that's equal to $g$.

  <p>
    If the sensor were in free fall, the housing and the proof mass would accelerate downwards at $9.8 m/s^2$. To keep the proof mass centered in the housing, the two springs would be pulling equally so the NET force from the springs would be $0$ and the accelerometer would measure $0$ acceleration.
  </p>

  The output of an accelerometer is actually:
  $$
    a_{accel} = \frac{1}{m}(F - F_g)
  $$
  
  A full 3-axis accelerometer would need three of these in orthogonal directions.
