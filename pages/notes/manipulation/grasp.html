    <li>Inherently safe</li>

      <li>Robust to geometric uncertainty</li>
      Inherently less dependent on perception or geometric models which have uncertainty and therefore are more robust.

      <p>
        An accurate point cloud registration of the object being manipulated along with its pose isn't required. All that is required is to place or get close to the oject at roughly the right location.

and control point of view okay and the model the way i would love for you to think
with me about this for a little bit is actually i think there's a very simple model that can get pretty far
okay so um let's say i have an object to be
maybe it's on wheels if you want to think about i want objects that can only move um
horizontally so we'll call this our manipuland
okay and we'll have our maybe our hand we have two hands we'll do bimanual
stuff okay and because i like to keep the geometry simple i'll have a point finger
right and these things are only moving
the only degrees of freedom are left to right of the of the hands right and i want to manipulate the
manipuland okay and maybe you can see where i'm going here
i want to compare this version which is a pretty rigid picture and i'm just driving the hand around with an you know
the same picture but now if i have my point contact here and i attach my my finger to my hand
with a spring okay and maybe it's even a spring and a
damper if you like your mechanical drawings a little bit more complete i could put a damper
here between my hand my finger
and my manipulate end right object is a little shorter to write
okay
and let's think a little bit critically about the differences between those two
systems right can we actually say that
a system that has a spring in it is inherently more safe is inherently more robust geometric uncertainty does it
have all these uh attributes that we we say
okay so um if i were to take this and write my you know rigid body mechanics for for either
of these two and i were to now bring this hand in contact with the manipuland
then what happens at the moment of contact let's maybe think about first the moment of contact
the rigid model is going to have an impulsive event right if there's a if this is strictly
rigid and you're not allowed to penetrate and you have a velocity before the
contact and you're not allowed to have velocity after the contact then you must have had an impulsive collision
at the moment of contact it could be elastic it could be inelastic but there's no question that something happened in zero time in order to keep
you from going inside the object okay so the rigid
has an impulsive collision
now in this one the purely soft one here
if i have you know a point finger here that is massless if i assume for a
minute it's massless right this is like assuming a spherical cow it's kind of
it's very useful but a little silly right then
if this is massless and i have a perfect spring here then i don't have an impulsive collision right
okay so you could argue in that sense that you know it might be maybe it's better
for the object to not have that impulsive force that hits it all of a sudden right you can
make those those collisions larger or smaller depending on your you know your momentum i guess i didn't
add at the moment of collision but it is true that if you can
can remove that mass completely then you get rid of the impulse okay and really um you know i want to make
sure that that i'm clear this is a this is an artificial scenario this never actually happens
right really we always have something that looks more like this right
and we have some mass of my finger here and we have some imperfect spring
that has a stiffness k maybe a damping b let's say
and i have a mass of my hand here
okay so this is you know this is the perfect model case but i
think in reality we should be thinking rather you know what is the relative mass
of the finger you know but before the spring and after the spring
okay and then what is the relative spring constant or you know relative stiffness
how large house how stiff is my spring right and it and that of course only matters relative to
the mass again the the to give you a total um
resonant frequency or or you know all the all the characteristic dynamics are going to depend on the ratios of mass
and the spring constant okay so i think the um
the analogy to be more fair would be you know how much benefit is it
to have my mass of my finger particularly low in my saw my stiffness
low compared to the mass of my robot right and you can tell that in a design like
this right this is trying to make you know the mass of the finger look more like the mass of the latex making the
bubble right and the stiffness quite soft where the the bubble deflects
you know easily and and potentially over a large deformation before you have the immediate
effects of the of the hand you know at the moment of of collision
that that part seems reasonable okay what about at steady state
like what you know what about my steady state forces like once i'm in collision now and i'm you know applying some force
on them on the on the hand here you know from my whole robot what forces can i apply
in steady state
how do the masses of my finger and the stiffness of my spring and relative to
my hand affect my steady state forces
they don't they don't right right at some point you know once i've hit a rest
length of my you know if i knew my new rest length of the spring then the forces i'm applying here are being
completely imparted here right so in steady state
there's no difference effectively
so if your robot has enough strength to crush
i guess mickey mouse right then your soft robot has that strength and your hard robot has that strength so
inherent safety maybe is not fair at steady state i would say
and i would say maybe even more importantly would be that um you know springs can be
dangerous i mean i like like you can store energy in springs right so you could uh
you could potentially take a pretty soft looking thing and kind of load it up you know
make it into a catapult you know and fire off some pretty large forces if you're not careful right so
so i always block a little bit when people say that that you know soft is inherently safe i think
you have to do a little bit more to get safety from soft you know dissipation i think
does inherently pull energy out of the system if you have damping in your soft element which most
soft things do then that pulls energy out and that is inherently a stabilizing and maybe a
safer point of view but i think stiffness alone doesn't make you safe
right
that's kind of a strange thing to write but i'll i'll leave it okay um
there's a trade-off of course right so um if you do make these things soft then
you can reduce your impact impulse right you can you don't change your steady
state dissipation can remove but you give something up if you add a soft spring
between your actuators and the world right what do you give up in the you
know linear systems senses yeah there's a there's a there's a word
that some of you know i'm sure yeah control i mean not officially
controllability is boolean but you could somehow reduce your controlled bandwidth would be the right
right so what do i mean by that let me just finish the thought real quick but if my goal
in the linear system sense if my goal is to make this uh execute uh let's say a sine wave
trajectory okay and um and i'd like to uh you know
look at the what my finger has to do as the frequency of that sine wave
gets larger right the work that i'm going to have to do goes up fast if i have a very soft
uh actuator and then and what that implies then is that if somebody surprises you with a disturbance or
something your ability to uh respond and like accurately control
the high frequency behavior of this system is is poor right your
your control authority at high frequencies i guess is what really gets you right because you've given up something with
the with the softness right so if you if you have a hard robot
infinite bandwidth and control authority then you should always be able to outperform a soft
robot you can always act like you're soft right so in practice once we when we're putting
this in it's somehow admitting that our bandwidth is practice and practice limited in a meaningful regime sorry yes
please that's required to drive a soft robot is
also lower than in the state case like thinking about the task of grasping an egg with a rigid robot you need infinite
bandwidth good but you need you could probably do like a one-horse
controller good so so um
so there was a there was a comment for those hearing about uh you know what if i'm trying to hold an egg right and i
have an egg-like uh example coming in a minute um so uh
yeah is it that maybe if i have a soft robot the requirement on my bandwidth is less and therefore i can get away with
the softness yeah i think um i agree with the spirit of your comment i might say that the task
demands a certain amount of bandwidth and many of the tasks we try to do with soft robots
don't require high bandwidth right i might say it a little bit differently but i those two do play together i think the place where soft
wins is when your bandwidth requirements are low and actually probably for a lot of things we do in manipulation our
bandwidth requirements are very low right certainly holding an egg i wouldn't think
would be a particularly high frequency
okay great great so i said if you had um if you had a perfect stiff robot couldn't you always do better okay and
yeah yeah good and so you're pointing out that that um a contact event is like you know ideally a delta function in
practice because things aren't perfectly stiff it's going to be a very uh short time event right so you so you're right
i think you need very high bandwidth to perform incredibly well through a contact event
right like exceedingly high bandwidth and so therefore why try why not let the mechanical
system handle that initial contact event and then you you do your thing afterwards after the fact i
completely agree that's a very good way to think about it
okay so in this picture i know a very simple picture but i think hopefully a helpful
picture so we talked a little bit about the safety uh claim and maybe the
the bandwidth i i we mentioned quickly here um is there a sense in which it's robust
to um geometric uncertainty in this picture right is one
sort of more or less robust to geometric uncertainty i mean that's a claim people it's sort
of easy to make when you see a video like this what is how does it play out in this simple diagram
yeah please i'm thinking about like the established a case and thinking about
very like varying shapes in the soft case i would expect some sort of like continuity properties on the force like
if you change if you establish the grass and you change the shape the force should only change proportional to the
change in shape because you're you know just changing the length of your spring that should change
the force of the continuously but if you had a completely rigid grasp and you established it and you shrunk the object a little bit
you would expect a discontinuous okay good so so um
so your thought experiment here to summarize is that um imagine i'm in contact and i've got i've made a contact
with my you know rigid or very stiff thing and i suddenly shrunk or expanded the geometry that's nice um
then yeah this is going to have i mean again i guess it's it's this is
never exists right so we're in the very stiff cases more thoughtful it could have a large reaction force that gender
that gets generated um so you're in some sense your sensitivity of your controller might be higher because of a
this geometric uncertainty right i mean i think in the even in the super simple case you could
if you thought this was at you know a two centimeter wide brick and you and it's actually a 1.9 centimeter brick
you could end up right here and just try to lift it up and completely miss uh or if you were you know trying to
push inside it you would be exerting very large forces and fighting against it
i agree but i actually think the bigger case
let's see i want to distinguish softness from position and force control these are
comparable ideas and they're separable ideas right so
once we have this idea that everything is at least maybe the stiffness is very large if i have a
kooka with a metal exterior but it's but it's there's a stiffness there and
we always put at least a rubber pad or something between our metal and our and our contact right
position control i think is going to be vulnerable to geometric
perception errors but force control is pretty good right we saw examples of flipping up boxes
without really estimating anything right and i think it's healthy in this picture to think
about this as a force sensor in fact most force sensors are somehow
you know having some material of known stiffness and you're measuring the deflection of
that material if you have a known spring stiffness and you can measure this deflection then you've got a force
sensor okay so i think in this simple picture you
can achieve robustness to geometry just by being in
a force control mode instead of being in a position control mode and i think maybe in my mind the
argument for geometric robustness is somehow not as great you know i don't i could do this maybe
my ability to do force sensing might be more or less depending on k
but i don't think i need to be a bubble to be better at immune to perception errors here
so let's make our diagram a little bit more rich because i do think geometric robustness
is a real thing um but i think we need a more expressive
picture to see it okay so um
i hope you're okay with these sort of silly diagrams but
okay let's say i've got my hand my object
my hand here okay and instead of one point finger
let's make an entire array of point fingers
okay they can have dampers too and on the side too of course yeah
now things get more interesting right
so let's say i start squeezing my hand together and let's say i'm i'm uh you know large
k you know the stiff regime
and i don't know i mean in this case i haven't even given my hand the ability to to
to do well with a lot of geometric information but but or if i just had geometric uncertainty and i was you know
choosing my pose as i was coming in you could get a similar picture well let's think about the type of
contact that you'd get if you just start squeezing your hand together and you have a pretty stiff set of springs
right i think it'd be pretty easy to exaggerate it here like i've got some
object here it'd be pretty easy to get in a situation where
you're in contact sort of in one or two places here you know the first part of your
weird finger looking thing is in contact
and the rest of them they're sort of no contact right
is that picture clear okay now the picture of course changes
if i'm in a very soft regime you could imagine you know
for some stiffnesses and some objects or whatever being in a situation where the same forces that produced this situation
in a stiff regime could produce this very different situation in a soft regime right where you might have a
larger force there because it's you know because it's compressed the spring more but i'll have forces
everywhere right may be proportionate i should be more
careful to make them proportional but i think you get my my drift okay so why does that matter
um let's say we're going to start lifting the object up if our goal is to lift the object up
okay how what amount of squeezing force do i need to apply in
order to successfully lift the object up right i need to have enough vertical
force to fight gravity right
every one of my contacts is limited by friction
so at every point of contact here i've got some friction cone
right maybe they're uniform everywhere in this first example
here okay in order to successfully i've got the
same thing happening on this side right
in order to successfully achieve liftoff the vertical component of my force
coming up here which is has to stay inside the friction cone if i don't want to slip you know
is going to be limited you know my force tangential is going to be less than or equal to mu
of my force normal by the static friction law right that's
my friction cone okay i'm going to have to squeeze hard in this regime i might have to squeeze
hard in order to achieve enough friction in order to get up high okay
in this regime where i have more possible contacts i can potentially even with the same
material properties the same friction properties i could potentially squeeze less
to achieve the same liftoff okay now that
could have stability implications for in a number of different ways okay but um it seems at least indicative that
maybe this would be a better grasp i think the real picture is actually
more subtle than that right um i kind of tried to pick
arrows to draw that were roughly landing on the normal surfaces there but what i mean i've also got some
contacts potentially here that have um
friction cones that are you know using the same coefficient of friction but potentially on very different normals
right and i think actually the world of possible contact forces opens up pretty quickly
right so now i'm firmly in the camp where if i
can contact an object like this with like a hole in the continuum a whole patch of
contact instead of a point contact then my ability to manipulate the object
seems improved right let me be careful you could you could
still argue the counterpoint that you've given something up right if you wanted to somehow explicitly control the contact
forces and you're making contact in all these different places with all these different normals then you know to be able to regulate
exactly the normal force might be almost impossible now because you wouldn't be able to know exactly what forces but to achieve
some you know sufficient force to pick it up or to resist a wrench that would be another standard thing would be if
someone came and knocked this you know how likely is it to pop out of my hand or something like this
a grasp that has substantial patch contact seems like a better grasp most of the time
okay so i think you know for me the difference from point contact
to surface or people call it patch
contact patches contact is a really big deal and i think that's
where a lot of the um you know the benefits of of softness for
geometric robustness and the light come from and i think it's what kind of captured
my imagination when i saw these videos right is that you just really didn't have to know the pose of the object you didn't
have to know where it was but you're going to have this like huggable loving embrace
almost automatically with like an open loop arm motion right it's pretty good
um let me go out of order because i screwed
up so i guess one more point before
i go on to the sensing aspect of it let's compare back in these pictures
here maybe i'll work with this one let's compare sensing
or stiffness of the spring let's say right at the skin
versus something more distal right so i talked about iwa having elastic joints
and when we talked about in some of you you've asked in your project how do i do you know contact sensing
how do i know when i'm in contact with the wall for instance you know if i'm writing or something like this um with
the ewa and the answer is you look at the joint torques you know the external torques on the joint that's where your
joint that's where your contact sensors are on ewa right you could of course take your e1 and put another sensor at
the end or in the hand or something but by default the eu gives you some ability to do it in the joints okay so
um you know what what is the picture difference here so maybe i have my skin
if i will down here with a low mass and a k here
and then i've got my my finger or my my distal links
and then i have my um you know my elbow or something up
here or my main forearm a more distal link right i'm still just
thinking about the one dimensional easy to think about mass spring damper sort of case
my claim is that if i were to put you know some sort of rubber tips or something on the end of the ewa then i
can do some amount of force control and sensing and people do very successfully with ewa right using
this as my force sensor right he's using that the fact that there's a stiffness in the joint and this is my force sensor
and i'd like to sort of contrast that with if you were to try to put your softness
and your sensor more co-located with the contact right
and it's not um i mean it's a subtle argument that talks about bandwidth it talks about all the things
we talked about and and you can do it in the linear systems sense but um
i think overall if there are i think advantages to having
uh you know a contact sensor that is more co-located with the with the actual event and keeping your
your actual initial contact mass very low so this is something that when i showed you
this video before from from terry um where he was you know using this bubble
uh sensor that i was talking about um to do writing right
he had ignored the ewa joint sensors and was using was just demonstrating
that using the skin as a contact force sensor was sufficient to close a control
loop that was allowed allow him to write on the board right so
the i think our tactile sensors ability to do that and how do we close feedback loops that's a growing technology
but i think it's an exciting one i think we can potentially um you know move our
softness and our our sensing you know closer and closer to the the point of interest
okay that's just like a you know
one way to think about softness and you know hopefully a helpful one
let's think about the sensing aspect of it
so um you know we have amazing skin and i actually put a picture of like the you know the skin towards the end we'll
talk about what's missing for my robot sensors but you know i guess my my introduction i studied it
back when i was grad student i was in the neuroscience department right and i took the classes on uh you know the
basic brain and cognitive science classes where we learned about the sensory system and all of the incredible sensors you have
in your finger tip right and everywhere but especially your fingertips right um
so what are the possible signals we could get out of a tactical sensor on a robot i mean i used to
when i was working on walking i was i would have been happy if i just had a reliable binary you know
contact no contact
binary switch we did a lot of work on walking just like if you can just tell me with any
higher accuracy when my foot hits the ground i would already be happy right maybe that's still a little bit true
today okay you know we've implied here that and i think a common request would be to
have some sort of force sensing at the from your uh your tactical sensors right
and i think there's a characteristically different amount of you know request from a sensor to give a
normal force versus a shear force
but there's other things too right you can people have built robot sensors that try
to estimate you know temperature
to estimate um you know try to we could talk about the physics of it but to try
to somehow recognize texture or or roughness for instance
these are all if you wanted to like if i reached into a toolbox and wanted to find you know with my i can't see
inside the toolbox and i wanted to use my exquisite tactile sensing to find the right wrench let's say you know if i
feel something that doesn't feel very metal i mean metal feels cold and has a certain roughness and i i've got a strong signal
not just from the geometry but also from all these other signals right
you know so this would have been my probably the the beginnings of my list a few years ago
but something really did change um fairly recently where i think more and
more we're thinking about you know these are all things that you might sort of think about when you think about tactile
sensors as measuring a point okay but if you like my silly diagram at the
top there right um i think there's really something to be said for thinking about
tactile sensing as a geometry sensor okay and possibly
even a dense geometry sensor
and that was a pretty big change for me to think um you know maybe even if i'm buttoning oh i don't have any buttons on
this shirt this is but uh if i had a shirt with buttons and i wanted to button it right
you know what do you think you're using with your fingertips are you trying to estimate the forces that you're applying
to the button or are you sort of getting a sense that the button's going through the whole
by virtue of feeling some sort of geometry i don't know if i completely know the
answer but it feels like a pretty good geometry it feels like geometry is pretty important in a lot of the things
that the thought experiments that ted adelson had me run through and we started talking a lot about this
and ted i think had a great impact when he's introduced
this um you know geometry view of tactile sensing
which i'm going back to my here we go right so ted introduced this well you know with
chemo and introduced this sensor gel site many of you probably heard about it but let me
just sing its praises for a minute okay so basically
they ask the question of you know what happens if i put a camera behind the skin
how well could i do with that and how can i make that really effective okay and there's a couple subtleties about
making that effective right so so one of the things that makes that effective is you'd like to have
the the camera worry about the geometry of the contact but
not worry about all of the rgb complexity of the world or the lighting conditions of the world or anything like
that okay so what they did is they they made this small gel layer
hence gel site they found a nice way to paint the coatings uh the the top layer of
this so that when you depressed let's say an oreo hypothetically onto this
gel layer the image from the other side was a beautiful rendering of the
geometry of the contact without all of the complexity of lighting conditions or or um you know
the complexity of sort of real world vision let's say so that's a reasonable thing to try to
do and and what they showed was that it had a lot of really nice
properties um right so there's in ted's lab there's all kinds
of different goos whatever and it's super funny he you know you can
there's enough of it floating around mit these days you can probably get your hands on some and just start putting your own finger and see you know put a
dollar bill on there put a um you know you can see like the hair the hair on your finger or the the
the grains of a dollar bill through this thing and one of the reasons that it's nice that the
rgb signal doesn't come through is that they're able they were at the time doing strictly
geometric reconstructions using photogrammetry so in a controlled lighting situation with the rgb of the
world excluded they could just put a red green and a blue light in known locations
and do sort of a classic computer vision trick for extracting depth
from those um that now colored image okay and it's just awesome like you could just
see see everything you know this is beautiful geometry sensor
okay that's a pretty big pad to be like sticking on your fingertip but
people have been scaling it down and i think the vision is is is that we'll have these things scaled
down so if you have
dense geometry available a dense geometry
available in your fingertip then i think it connects back pretty
quickly to all of the things we already talked about in the geometric perception lectures right so as an example remember
we talked about dart where we had point cloud measurements coming in we talked about non-penetration constraints
um you know and then we did our pose a real-time pose estimation and tracking right that was just one of the
algorithms we talked about in geometric perception and that was based on this idea of
having a depth camera that was looking at the scene right we got our point cloud we also had our non our free space
constraints all these things you hopefully remember a bit about from dart okay
if you have a dense geometry sensor in your fingertip then it's like you just have one more
incredible depth sensor available inside your your finger okay but it's um you know it's got a short
maximum range that's okay i mean that gives it a it's a you know lovable uh limitation i
guess right um and but it gives you you know information that's not available from from other sensors
so um you know when we started playing with um gel site with with ted that was the
point that that we tried to make greg made was that if you have a dense geometry sensor in your fingertip
it snaps right into the geometric perception pipelines and you can do pose estimation
tracking you name it directly through your combination of
head mounted sensors and dense geometry sensors in your fingertips so as an
example of an application that was enabled by that if you wanted to do a
an insertion right that required some kinematic accuracy and you wanted to track the position of the let's say
screwdriver that had to fit in a relatively small hole then i mean the first thing that happens
we've talked about before is that whenever you start touching things your head mounted cameras often quickly get
occluded by your hand but even more so you can get more accuracy from these very local
you know dense sensors in order to to take out any of the remaining uncertainty sort of and do finer scale
insertions
this one's ignoring gel site using gel site and ignoring gel site it maybe wasn't as profound as we had originally
imagined when we made it but this one is you know basically missing the hole and this one's going to make the hole i want
to did why did it make the hole
i remember it being more profound but that was the with and without just sight
that's one in a series of of of works that people have done with um with gel site alberto's lab has
taken gel site and made a more robust version of it
in gel slim that is a you can see these sort of similarly
architected sensors
gel slim has got like a really real i mean we used to rip the gel site off the finger all the time it's kind of um
i mean again i love gel side but let me just make the point right so it's kind of frustrating to have like this exquisite
geometry sensing right here okay but then if you happen to reach in and it doesn't
hit exactly where your sensor is then not only are you blind but you rip the sensor off right so that was kind of
frustrating and that was just the state of the you know state of the sensor as when it started you know this one's got
a much tougher fabric it's removed all of the you know the
the i think the frailty on the edges it's still limited to making contact on the sensor
the geometry is also different um so the photogrammetry i believe is gone in this version uh you
know rachel can correct me if i'm wrong but i think they've switched mostly to doing uh
depth reconstruction using deep recon you know deep learning approaches
to reconstruction uh because the photogrammetry required a particular geometry of the of the red green and
blue sensors and and that was constraining in the geometries that you could build your sensors and this i think
used a longer throw and gave up on the the strict photo photogrammetry reconstruction
is that true yeah and the work here by the way is also
awesome i mean not only did it use the tactile sensors but it used it to do cool things showing feedback control uh
of you know where objects being moved were observed as
being you know requiring a different action and it even has like a you could say a task in motion planning level at
the top to to be very robust
this sensor here is also inspired by gel site it's a different approach
again living with the the two-fingered gripper is kind of limited but beautiful in what you can do
right you can do a lot of things with a good brain and a simple hand
on the inside of this is a dot pattern okay and we've got a depth camera inside here so
we actually have a connect or it's a it's a picoflex inside here okay that is um is actually doing
explicit depth reconstruction and then we put dot patterns on here in order to get shear and other forces
and this is super robust and we've done a lot of cool manipulation with it included you
know one of the things you do is you say i'm immune to the transparency of wine glasses and and
i'm you know subtle to the to the touch so we can do things like stacking wine glasses
so i do think we're in this sort of series of very cool advances in sensing
the geometry sensing is part of the story but we do actually have these other types of sensors or
let's say camera based geometry sensing is only part of this um i told you about punyo is this is just the hand on puno
and we have this sort of bigger ambition of building out full um
you know baymax like uh humanoid that's making contact all over
the place and using tactile sensing all over the body this is the project that alex is leading at tri
and just as another example right there's a whole bunch of different ways to measure geometry or force
which of course if you know the stiffness of your sensor are related this one is an inductive sensing in the
chest actually so when you are picking up a massive water bottle with
your chest then we have a sparser i mean humans also have a lot more
density and there's technical sensing in the in the hands than in the other parts of their body um
and so i think uh a simpler cheaper technology is is warranted okay
and even along the arms we're just using pressure sensors in the pocket air pockets covering the the arms
inductive sensing has been used capacitive sensing has been used resistive sensation basically every
possibility right for sensing resistors have been used often
they all have their different you know pros and cons
i'll try that one more time just in case i get lucky but maybe i don't get to show you the
iit icub i believe is this one very cool initial sensing skin i would
say one of the most advanced systems level integration of
sensing skin technology on a humanoid robot is this from the italian institute of technology the icub skin
i encourage you to check it out
they not only built nice tactile sensors they could be arrayed but they just like
just incredible engineering to to make these huge arrays that could be formed to the
to the skin of the body and they just had like a whole humanoid with beautiful skin and there's videos of them you know
applying forces and and controlling the robot on a full humanoid
extremely cool
c-cells are pretty or mit is a pretty good place i guess for tactile sensing voice x group has also been doing
novel tactile sensors right so this is uh one of a series of things where they've started they've basically been sewing um
dense uh i think this was fsr at the time um
force-sensitive material into fabric right and they have
they have smart carpets now they have smart gloves and they have like just great instrumentation i think the
the possibilities for robots to be completely coated with aren't with dense sensors
for humans to have a more immersive you know vr ar experience with these kind of sensors
i mean tactile sensing is just i think finally coming of age it's actually kind of weird that it took so long i mean
everybody has known forever how important tactile sensing is and it just took a very long time
ted used to say he used to say i've got this great tactile sensor and i go to the roboticists and i say i've got this
great tactile sensor and they're like we don't know what to do with it you know that's that's great information and we don't know what to do with it if you
gave it to us right so maybe i guess we're the roboticists are finally waking up
but let me you know i'll i'll finish here by saying that the human skin is actually incredible and there are many
other things that you can do um that
that the human skin does that we're not doing i think in most of our tactile sensing yet so let me just you know point out a few subtleties in
these tactical sensors i won't
name all of my anatomy anymore i don't think i could without i mean i remember all the
corpuscles and purkinjes and stuff but just barely
some of them measure force some of them measure temperature some of them measure vibration
right so that actually the signal that you'd get if i were to try to measure the roughness
of this there's a part of it possibly that is about the spatial forces that you feel
along the along your finger and the fact that you have you know your skin has curves and stuff it certainly matters
okay but there's also a big part of your signal that comes in the time domain right then you have high frequency
vibrations that are actually a strong indicator of of the s of the roughness of your fabric and stuff like that
these are these are things that are totally baked into our human sensing and and i mean people talk about it in
research but i think they're not mainstream in robotics yet um
so i do think robustness is less of an issue now
but it's still an issue i think
as is surface area or it's a surface coverage
this story i said of somehow ripping off a gel site or
or you know reaching into the toolbox and having the first contact between my hand and the
and the world be not where my sensor happens to have incredible resolution but somehow on the edge of the sensor where i had some
plastic housing and uh and actually that's the part that almost always bumps into things first
you know these are still i think practical issues that are getting better and better
but they're still they're still real
sensing slip is a super interesting one um everybody thinks if i have tactile
sensing then i can be more robust because i can sense when things slip okay actually
francois had a great uh example of it he really wanted to close a feedback loop on slip
that was the the project with the abb arm in alberto's lab
and i remember him saying it as defense it's just too hard basically like
slip happens fast slip is an instantaneous event i guess you know you've gone from static
friction to a sliding friction regime and in most cases with the bandwidth of our sensing plus
control by the time something slips it's too late right
so people talk a lot about so i've seen very few successes of
control systems that react to a slip in order to recover okay people talk about trying to
predict slip they talk there's a notion of incipient slip where you're like on the verge of slipping and you try to
detect pre-slip events and avoid them and stuff like this but um but i think it's too much to say that
tactile sensing gives you the ability to recover from slip and maybe in very like if something slides extremely slowly out
of my hand then maybe but but you know blocks falling out of my grasp and stuff
happens pretty fast
and there are a few others that are this is kind of just my random list of other things i wanted to say sorry um but
i've always wondered uh and people have often talked about
proximity sensing versus contact
sensing and there's been projects through the years that pop up and have produced a new proximity sensor versus contact
sensor so um as humans our tactile sensing is limited that we don't feel
things until we till they actually make contact with us almost i mean we do have hair right
as mammals you know so so uh yeah so so we do actually get a
little bit from that and and i i think it's interesting that you should think about what what signal your hair is good
for right i think it's not only for warmth and other things but you can maybe tell if there's something
coming by a little bit of aerodynamics on your hair you can certainly feel as your hairs bend out of the way it's
pretty amazing sort of stuff that happens here because of this instrumentation at the bottom of your
hair follicles okay but there's really i mean we talked about gel site sort of
having a limited throw at the skin and being that being a good thing in terms of making the sensing simpler but why
shouldn't our robots go ahead and detect something before it makes contact why shouldn't we bury in our skin things
that are sense the uh you know the approach of something right
the proximity of something um it's interesting i it just seems like an obviously good
thing to do and it hasn't really taken off right i mean i could list a couple possible
reasons why i don't know if people here know why but i mean i think it is i've heard from
people that do it that it's hard to make a proximity sensor that works uniformly for all types of objects you know like
to have something that would respond to a metal and a wood and whatever like you know a lot of technologies that are
behind the skin and are using non-vision based techniques are sensitive to material properties
you know some things are magnetic or whatever but i wouldn't be surprised if you know
in a few years where we are sensing contact before it happens it seems like just an obviously good idea
okay so that was a um i didn't do my chip demo but i i you know
i thank you for bringing the chips by the way i was gonna i was just gonna make the point that i could you know squeeze a potato chip in the rigid
object and it would break and i could squeeze it in this i'll at least squeeze it in this it's the distributed contact point right
so this is the standard thing would be the egg you know it's good for the egg it's good for the
potato chip it's not just like i can produce more forces but it's pretty nice to sort of distribute the load across an
entire surface you know it's good for the object you're hugging too right
i can put a lot of force normal force on this and the chip's fine and i've got a few broken chips from playing with my
rigid clamp just before lecture and some grease on my fingers
yes we started off talking about all of with these was like thing like the thing
manipulated without any feedback what was the gap that led to all this
tactile sensitivity
yeah i mean for a long time you and maybe even still today like the soft robotics journals wherever um there's
like incredible fabrication technology incredible results i can hit my thing with a hammer i can put it on the
charcoal grille um and then it says like control is future work right
sorry i think it's still true but everybody knows that you should do
control i think like the the things you can do in open loop are you know enveloping grasps work really
really well right um but but there's a whole bunch of things in manipulation that is more than
enveloping grasp that's been a theme over the you know if you wanted to do the type of stuff you know even the bottle turning right the you know the
stuff that rachel is showing or any number of things we've shown over the term you got to do something more
than just like the open loop stable right you want to be able to react to your environment
dig into the the toolbox and find the wrench there's all kinds of motivations for that
i do think that we don't have all those pieces i mean
deep learning so geometric perception works well for it with tactile if you once you have dense geometry
you can combine also in a deep pipeline you can bring your tactile sensors in especially if they're dense geometry and you can put
them through a convolutional network then that works pretty well um yunzu in our group has done some pretty
incredible things with that other people have as well um so i think it's coming
but but we haven't seen i think its full power yet
yes
good question so what about proximity versus a hand mounted camera but i think
hand and mounted cameras have been less useful than i expected and i think the certainly depth cameras have a
maximum range and they also have a minimum range and that minimum range oftentimes when you talk to the manufacturers they're like well we just
never up nobody ever asked us to make a shorter minimum range that we're always worried about pushing out the maximum never shortening the minimum so there's
probably hardware improvements that if it became a priority could be done but but even you know rgb techniques
it seems like once you get pretty close um the rgb signal is just not as good you know maybe your camera is getting
blurry but also just the field of view is very small right um so there and then once you're in contact
i think you can start getting local but interesting geometry again but there seems to be this sort of intermediate
space where um you're too close for a camera to be super useful you do you're not touching in in contact
yet um and maybe maybe we will have cameras looking out all over our bodies
that's a that's a possible future and maybe and just and have and rely on the rgb uh and and maybe just because the price
point of you know iphones bringing down cameras and stuff maybe that's the reason that's the way it's going to go
it's a good question okay you know the big points
i think you can think a lot about the mechanics of softness the benefits or trade-offs of softness even with linear
spring mass damper systems i really think that a lot of people have used that kind of model as a great effect to
think about the pros and cons of softness the real world has
more interesting geometry and the like but a lot of the lessons transfer and you know the fact that tactiles can
be a geometry sensor i think it's just a really cool connection to the type of tools we've already talked about you can do pose estimation tracking but you can
also do shape estimation there's object detection all of the sort of classical perception techniques
you can think about doing with tactile you know it's a little different because you have very local
features as opposed to global features but the same kind of ideas work
all right so let me last let me end by just kind of giving a overview
kind of a wrap up of what we've done over the term just to put a bow on it here okay
we've done a lot of things and i appreciate i mean i i sort of feel
like the class is taking material that maybe should be is
still sort of like research seminar class and it's trying to present it as a textbook class and we're somewhere in
between and there's some rough edges and i appreciate your patience but it's pretty fun to sort of be in a field that's kind of on the verge of those two
things right so so but let's just
you know lay the landscape a little differently than i did in the chapters just to to think about that right so we
talked about kinematics you know dynamics
simulation right that was definitely a a big theme
uh you know in simulation i emphasized the signals and systems view of the world
right and some of you hate that this week
but it's good no i mean i was but i i do think that um to scale to very complex
systems i mean you hear from the the the big players that that are trying to build these massively complex systems
and have a level of robustness that somehow that that way of arranging um all the
different components together is i think a very scalable and robust i mean simulink is not a successful product for
so many years without reason and i think in manipulation everything snaps into
we're seeing that over and over again so you got a taste of that i hope you didn't dislike it too much right
and then we had um sort of the manipulator view of the world right
where we talked about you know the manipulator control ideas
from you know differential ik
to force control and hybrid control to stiffness control
right that's about how do you move your arm around ignoring all the complexity of the world
right regulate forces and the like we talked about planning sort of in that view of the world too
about you know rrts trajectory optimization
and that was um our focus in the planning was about again about sort of the robot's view of the world uh
with its eyes closed right how do you get from point a to point b if you've brought in some obstacles maybe you're
gonna plan around the obstacles but it was thinking mostly about the motion of
the robot not the motion of the world
of course talked about a bunch about perception
with a big i wanted to emphasize first some of the geometry and the geometric perception
from icp you know dart
et cetera for pose estimation but we also talked about a bit about dense reconstructions
that came up a bunch i never spent a lecture on it but we it kept coming up um
and then of course the revolution and perception that's come from deep learning
and we you know segmentation pose estimation
but also new representations
i think the thing i'm most excited about with the deep learning approaches is that we can get fundamentally we don't
have to go all the way through to pose and we can potentially estimate much less than a full shape or
pose estimation algorithm maybe it's just the key points that was a simple example but maybe it's just some
latent representation that isn't even human intelligible that comes out of a deep learning system but is enough to do
good control
and then when we talked about controlling you know moving the actual objects in the world affecting the world
more you know when we got deeper into that the major approach
we talked about was rl right um
we did it before of course by relatively simple you know i'm going to come into contact close my hand and go
like this but when we started getting richer emphasis on the control of the environment
we started talking about mostly about rl reinforcement learning
right and all of its different uh variants but you know maybe slightly more general i
tried to emphasize the general awesomeness of i think visual motor policies
and whether you get them from rl or imitation learning or you know
model based rl or model free rl right i think the the opportunity to connect
you know these types of rich um you know sensing
possibly through novel representations directly to control policies is just so awesome and it's it's something that
um we're going to see more and more of we talked about high level
task planning
rachel gave a great lecture last week we talked about it a little bit early on
you know from strips
and bedital state machines
behavior trees
and then tamp last week actually i i told rachel after her
lecture that watching her you know her talk about it i i really i think you know next year i think this has got to
be even a more core piece of the class i think we got to move it up and it's just such an important piece of the manipulation
pipeline and to scale to much more complicated tasks i think i felt really inspired by
by that right so those are in my mind sort of the core components that we've been talking about
and we've talked you know tactile and other things have added on i hope some some elements
but it's like i say it's pretty fun to be in a place right now where you know
it sort of feels like we have a curriculum for manipulation right and uh um you know those those tools will get
more and more mature and the core concepts will be more and more mature and i hope that maybe um you know
there's value i hope the value that this class can bring is that trying to put these under
sort of the same umbrella and same symbols most of the time and uh you
know same code most of the time so i mean i think
the number one thing i want you to walk away with is that it's a super vibrant
research community it's a super vibrant problem i mean the number of people in
industry that care about manipulation is just skyrocketing i think the potential for it to
maybe to get grand you know to shape the future of humanity the future of work you know
life off earth i don't know it's pretty important stuff right maybe there are other important things out
there too but this is pretty important right so um yeah maybe this will be a foundation for you and i hope you some
of you continue on and uh and and push on and give us feedback and so that we can keep uh making the course better
good well your turn next so um thursday we will do the the
project videos and i think everybody knows the the deal but i hope many of you will come here to watch with us
we'll do a viewing session we have the room till five if we need it and uh you know we'll get oohs and oz and questions
if you're here to answer them and we have time and i'll see you then thank you
