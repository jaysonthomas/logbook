<section id="0"><h1>Intro</h1>
  A planning problem is an optimisation problem.
  In motion planning, given:
  <ul>
    <li>a cost function in the trajectory optimization case or</li>
    <li>a start and a goal in the randomized motion planning case</li>
  </ul>
  we design a single trajectory through space.
  We have good tools to do that, that can potentially 
  scale pretty well to large dimensions. As output, we get 
  $q$ as a function of time, $q(t)$.

        The policy that RL is trying to find
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <p>
    RL is trying to solve a bigger (?) problem, to find a policy
    (synonymous with a controller). The simplest analogy for a
    policy would be a vector
    field. Instead of having just a single path, for every q
    not just for every time, we'd like to know what direction we should 
    be going in, in order to accomplish the goal or the cost. 

    $$
      \dot q = \pi(q)
    $$

    $\pi$ represents the policy.    
  </p>
  By following the vector field, we can extract the trajectory, but
  RL is trying to capture what happens when we're 
  away from the trajectory.

  <p>
    There are similarities with RRT and PRM. RRT* (the optimising version of 
    RRT), explicitly makes the point, that if you keep sampling and 
    rewiring, we don't just end up with a path, but a policy - 
    a vector field that covers the entire space. So you can go from 
    planning algorithms to policies.
  </p>

  Online planning (making a plan on-the-fly based on the current state),
  is an example of a policy. This works if we can plan and execute the
  plan fast enough. This is the basis of Model predictive control. 

  <p>
    It is possible to use the planner to build the policy. 
    It shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Look for ways to blend them.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Comparison of the 2 methods</h1>
  In a sense, the goal of an optimization or a planning 
  problem is smaller. Since we're only interested in knowing
  what the $q$ should be for every $t$ along a particular path and
  not what the behaviour should be at all possible states,
  we can often plan for systems of very high dimensionality. 
  We're immune to the <code>curse of dimensionality</code>.

  <p>
    If were to make a grid and give a discrete answer for every point
    on the grid, the number of state variables to cover with a policy
    grows exponentially.
  </p>

  But, a single path is only parameterized by $t$ (which is always 1D)
  not by $q$, hence the output vector might be big, but it would
  scale much better through a high dimensional space.

  The counter argument
  is that sometimes plans can be extremely complicated to represent and
  sometimes very simple policies can actually describe the behaviour
  in very rich, complicated systems.

  <p>
    For example, for a manipulation task to lift a plate from the sink.
    It would be hard to make a plan for all the contact points of the 
    hand with the plate. But, it would be easier to write a controller that 
    moves the fingers till you touch the plate and then squeeze.
  </p>

  Hopping robot - simple controller that said, when you're on the ground, 
  jump! And when you're in the air, put your leg in front of you roughly 
  where you want to land. When you couple this simple behaviour 
  with the dynamical system which is the springy hopping robot,
  we get a beautiful rich output. It had just a few PD loops.

  <p>
    The view of obtaining policies from plans,
    presumes that we somehow have a measurement of
    and have estimated what $q$ is.
  </p>

  For an arm moving around, when $q$ is just the 
  state of the arm and we're doing motion planning, that 
  doesn't feel like a bad assumption. We have very good
  sensors along the arm that gives very accurate 
  measurements of the joint positions.

  <p>
    But if we want a bigger view of
    manipulation where the policy needs to know
    not just the state of the arm but needs to make 
    controlled decisions based on the 
    entire state of the arm plus the world ($x$).
    So, $u = \pi(x)$ where
    $x = \begin{bmatrix}
    q_{robot} \\
    v_{robot} \\
    q_{object} \\
    v_{object}
    \end{bmatrix}$.    
  </p>
  We don't have good instrumentation on any of the objects in
  the world.

  <p>
    Written like this, we assume the policy has a good
    estimate of the positions and velocities of the world.
    But, very often we don't even know what choice of $q$ 
    is a good state representation for the world.

    A good example is the problem of chopping onions 
    and everytime we make a cut, the number of pieces increase.
    It would be hard to write the pose and velocity 
    of all the pieces of the onion.
  </p>

  The broader view of a policy is one where
  it's not just a map from state to actions. It's 
  potentially a map from observations to actions and it's 
  a dynamical system. 
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>What is RL's role in manipulation</h1>
  High-level - Task planning. Eg: what we're going to pick up first.
  Low-level - There are continuous motions with very complex contact
  mechanics. It feels more like a 
  control problem where you really want to know what's going to happen 
  from all the different states and the exact details of what 
  happens along a particular trajectory are probably not as important.
  Policies are more suited to this level.
  It would be interesting to think about how the transition between the
  layers could happen gracefully.  

  <p>
    In legged robots, it's natural to think the low level 
    controllers
    would be responsible for balance and stabilisation, to keep 
    the robot upright no matter what step is taken.
    We would want to know what would happen if we took a 
    bad step.
    This feels very much like a policy. We could imagine having a 
    handful of policies that 
    could combine and be a very effective walker.
  </p>

  In manipulation, our hands do a diverse set of things constantly.
  There's no periodic, regular pattern like walking. 
  Every time we do something with 
  our hands we're doing something different that we've never done before.
  And maybe we've not see the exact same situation that is in front of us 
  at any given time, before. So that puts us in a place
  where we just need to figure out one thing, similar to the single query 
  rrt view of the world rather than a multi-query in the case of solving
  an entire feedback policy.

  <p>
    There's good logic to that. But may be, a relatively 
    small set of policies at the low level can probably 
    describe a lot of the 
    details of what we do with our hands. When we watch the 
    kinematics of people's hands 
    when they're doing maneuvers, it's actually relatively 
    low dimensional. 
    There are discussions about topics like eigen grasps.
  </p>
  We could potentially assemble a small number of 
  policies and achieve a great diversity of motions.
</section>
 
<section id="3"><h1>History of visuomotor policies</h1>
  In the classic view of control, we would sense, then plan
  a trajectory, then close our eyes and execute the trajectory.
  We can't do this in manipulation.
  But this burden of state estimation is just too great
  and it's not necessary to estimate the full state to 
  make good decisions.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:120px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/manipulation/20_classicViewOfControl.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Classic view of control
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  The state estimator could also be a simple sliding window.

  <p>
    This reduced burden on the state estimator used to be 
    called <code>Integrated perception and control</code>
    in the UAV space; i.e. solve estimation and control
    in a single system. Another term for it was
    <code>(Dynamic) Output feedback</code> vs full-state
    feedback.
  </p>

  In UAVs, whilst moving fast through forests, the aim
  was to do minimal sensing of the upcoming obstacles which
  was sufficient to make good short-term control decisions 
  instead of the full state feedback. Deep learning happened
  around 2015. In 2016, IPC started to be called
  <code>Visuomotor policies</code> in the manipulation space.
  It's the bigger view of writing a controller that
  goes directly from sensor to action. We'll explore if 
  there is state inside it. This is the reason
  to work on manipulation - how do you do control (output
  the right actions) based on just a rich stream of
  sensory information.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:120px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/manipulation/21_zoomedOutViewOfControl.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Zoomed out view of a control system
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  It's reasonable to have a static function
  that maps from the current observation $y$ to the current 
  action. But it's limiting. 

  <p>
    We already know it's limiting because even for 
    the simplest versions of output feedback in control like 
    linear gaussian optimal control, it
    already demands dynamic policies/controllers i.e.
    it is the Kalman filter state + LQR.
  </p>

  So another way to think about the static function
  is as a new dynamical system that has its own internal 
  state. An example (of such a dynamic controller) would be, 
  that the function would have 
  inside it, the state estimator which gives us the internal 
  state that is used by the controller within the same
  function. This is the optimal thing to do in a 
  linear gaussian quadratic optimal control problem - 
  to have a dynamic controller that estimates the 
  full state and makes decisions but that's not true in 
  general with LGQ (this last part is not yet clear to me).
  It is true in general that having dynamic policies 
  can do great things.
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Different ways of representing a system</h1>
  Q: What is the tradeoff between having a dynamic policy
  vs augmenting the policy with a history of observations?

  <p>
    The plant above is an input output dynamical system
    that has a stream of actuator commands as its input
    and it has to predict the stream of sensory outputs.
    Think of the controller block as having the same 
    stream of sensory inputs
    and a stream of output commands. So, this too is a 
    dynamical system.
  </p>

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:120px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/manipulation/22_fundamentalViewOfSystem.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Simplified, fundamental view of a control system
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  There are signals $y(t)$ coming in and actuator commands
  coming out and there is a system in the middle. 

  <br>
  There are many ways to represent a system. 
    
  <ul>
    <li>State space representation</li>
    $$
      x_c[n+1] = f_c(x_c[n], y[n])
      u[n] = \pi (x_c[n], y[n])
    $$

    $x_c[n]$ - is the internal state

    <p>
      This is a state space model where the
      state is explicitly written down and it is moved forward 
      in time with a difference or a differential equation, 
      $x_c[n+1]$. The outputs produced $u$ is given by the 2nd
      equation.
    </p>

    <li>ARMAX - Autoregressive Moving Average with Extra Input</li>
    <a href="https://bit.ly/3JUN1xa">Ref</a>.
    This is another good model of differential equations that 
    is a an auto regressive model. It's another example
    of an input-output dynamical system.

    <p>
      Here, $\pi$ takes a history of input observations ($y$), 
      but it also potentially takes a history of its own
      outputs $u$. That's why it's called auto regressive 
      because it gets to see its own output. It then predicts 
      its next controller $u[n]$.
    </p>

    $$
      u[n] = \pi(y[n], y[n-1], y[n-2], u[n-1], u[n-2])
    $$    
  </ul>

  Are they equivalently expressive? In the
  limit, for any finite horizon history, we could take 
  the history of 
  $y$, i.e. $y[n], y[n-1], y[n-2]$ and call that our state. 
  Then this would be a state-space model. 
  We can certainly always go from ARMAX to state 
  space representation.
  In the limit of infinite states, we can always go both ways. 
  But in practice, if we have a truncated history (the $y$s), 
  then ARMAX is good at some things and the 
  state space is good at others.

  <subsection id="4.0"><h1>Examples</h1>
    Let's take the example of trying to hit a 
    ping-pong ball. If we had to make a decision just purely 
    based on a single image, that seems inadequate. 
    If we had 2 images (or positions of the ball $y[n], y[n-1]$), 
    then we could estimate the direction 
    and velocity of the ball.
    If we had a slightly longer history, we could filter out 
    a little bit of measurement noise. This would be a very 
    reasonable local estimator of the ball's velocity. 

    <p>
      If we wanted to, for instance, remember if we've 
      already opened up the top drawer of the dishwasher 
      because we're about to pick up a mug and we're not 
      looking at the dishwasher right now;
      this would potentially involve
      remembering a long time into the future.
      Holding in memory a long history of observations
      would be painful. So ARMAX is good for short term
      memories.
    </p>

    But it can be very clean. If 
    for instance we're taking just a bunch of images in, 
    $y[n], y[n-1]$, we could just use a FF neural network
    to make a prediction. That's a very appealing thing 
    to do. We're pretty good at training those things. 

    <p>
      But remembering whether the dishwasher drawer is open
      feels like something that can be represented by a state. 
      Example, $X_{32}$ being the dishwasher is open.
    </p>

    These are very familiar concepts.  
    Even just looking at linear control theory,
    we know a lot of things about how to fit these 2 
    models to data, how to do motion 
    planning and apply trajectory optimization with/to them. 
    So there's nothing new about visual motor policies in 
    this discussion.
    
    <p>
      We get a choice about how to represent a dynamic 
      controller either with histories or state-space 
      representations or possibly combinations.
      A nice combination would be taking a
      simple filter bank of recent observations and using that 
      as a surrogate for state.
    </p>

  A recurrent neural network model is
  a state-space model. Example, long short-term memory.
  If we start representing dynamical systems with neural 
  networks, we've gotten new tools but the modeling 
  framework is old and well understood.

  <p>
    When we think about partial observability like POMDP, 
    i.e. if we want to have a dynamic controller that's reasoning 
    in a partially observable environment, we should think of
    the state of the controller as being a belief 
    representation 
    or some approximation of a belief representation
    instead of the kalman filter view of the world 
    where $x$ is the state of the system. 
    $x$ could be a compressed belief state for instance.
    If we're training a recurring network policy, then
    the internal dynamics should somehow build 
    up a belief or whatever is necessary to accomplish the task.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>What's new?</h1>
  The new thing we've learned is how to do computer vision 
  and NNs and data sets got big. So now people are
  writing policies using the entire image as input.
  
  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/24_visuomotorPoliciesNew.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        What's new in visuomotor policies these days!
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>  
  These days visual motor policies have a 
  big pre-trained network [resnet with millions 
  of parameters] that takes an entire image 
  from rgb space down to something smaller like a
  32-dimensional feature vector. Often times
  there's a relatively small policy that we're going to 
  represent - a relatively small network that tends to be 
  a multi-layer perceptron with 3 layers and 255 units. 

  <p>
    We can pre-train the network on an
    image-only task for instance and get potentially very good
    features out. Then if we're going to do reinforcement 
    learning or behaviour cloning, we can train a
    relatively much smaller network $\pi$ for the control given good 
    good features.
  </p>
  
  Often our control training algorithms are
  more data hungry and training all the way 
  through the resnet would be tough. Some people try to do 
  it or certainly fine tune through it but
  that's considered hard. 
</section>

<section id="6"><h1>How to design $\pi$?</h1>
  So the million dollar question then
  is how do we design the weights of our LSTM or our 
  FF network - how do we design $\pi$?
  
  <p>
    Again the new thing here is that perception works
    and we have images coming into our neural network.
    And the size of these images are large.
    Control people have thought about
    neural networks for a long time. 
  </p>

  The big answer these days is RL. 
  We will think about it as being useful at a low level 
  where we're doing dynamic things. 
  We will think of it from the standpoint of
  representing a policy instead of a plan, i.e. not for
  higher level decision making.

  <p>
    Given our problem formulation, RL is a very
    general purpose tool for trying to solve $\pi$. It makes 
    very few assumptions, as a consequence it is statistically 
    very weak.
  </p>

  We should consider RL if we
  don't know how to do something better. There are a lot of
  things we know from control and they should be blended 
  together and there's many ways to find $\pi$.

  <p>
    In particular today, there's a shortcut which is behaviour
    cloning. The reason this shortcut is good is because 
    RL has a lot of challenges with it in terms of sample
    efficiency; in terms of just whether it's going to 
    converge or not. It mixes up the fundamental questions of:
    
    <ul>
      <li>representation of the policy</li>
      <li>should we put cameras in</li>
      <li>what should the architecture be</li>
      <li>what should the action space be</li>
      <li>what should the observation space be</li>
    </ul>

    It mixes up all these questions with:
    <ul>
      <li>Did the RL algorithm perform well</li>
      <li>Did we give it enough samples or give it 
        enough roll outs</li>
    </ul>
    We can slice those down the middle if we take a shortcut 
    and try to do behaviour cloning instead.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="7"><h1>Behaviour Cloning Intro</h1>
  <i>behaviour cloning</i> is a subset of
  imitation learning which is also known as
  <i>learning from demonstration</i>.

  There are two major camps in imitation learning:
  <ul>
    <li>behaviour cloning</li>
    The goal is to try to use supervised learning
    to mimic a demonstration. It's very popular right now 
    and it's producing amazing demonstrations in manipulation.

    <p>
      <li>Inverse optimal control or Inverse RL</li>
      Instead of trying to take a demonstration 
      and learn the policy directly, we learn the cost function
      then do planning or control or some other form.
    </p>
  </ul>
  
  A human demonstrates examples of 
  dexterous manipulation on a robot.
  It is similar to feeding the input-output data 
  to the sensor-action map. To find a function which 
  describes the same map from sensors to actions, 
  we use supervised learning. Certainly we can apply supervised
  learning techniques to train $\pi$.
  This is the behaviour cloning paradigm.

  <p>
    We have controllers as a result of BC that are 
    making real-time decisions based on the camera-based 
    feedback as opposed to stop-perceive the world. The
    output controllers are weak but they perform very well
    with rich sensory inputs.  
  </p>

  The key ideas/challenges in Behaviour Cloning are:
  <ul>
    <li>Distribution shift</li>
    <li>Multi-modal demonstration</li>
    <li>Only as good as demonstrator</li>
    <li>Generalisation</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="8"><h1>Distribution shift</h1>
  We get a bunch of examples of $y$ coming in
  and $u$ going out from a human teleopping a robot .
  We could use supervised learning to train but Drew Bagnell 
  says behaviour cloning/imitation learning
  is not equal to supervised learning.
  Even though we can use the same gradient descent type 
  algorithms to train it there's some really important 
  differences. The biggest difference is because of feedback.

  <subsection id="8.0"><h1>Example</h1>
    Let's say we're training an autonomous car to drive 
    and we've got a a bunch of examples of people driving and 
    staying in the lane; i.e. we've got a bunch of of data 
    $u=\pi(y)$. We get an approximation $\hat\pi$ from
    supervised learning that's pretty close:
    $u = \hat\pi(y) = \pi(y) + \epsilon$.
    We've got an epsilon perfect supervision based loss.
    <p>
      What happens is after a single run (small move of the 
      car) we've predicted almost perfectly but we're 
      slightly away from where we were on the 
      original training data. The controller on the car
      now decides its output actions based on its current
      slightly off state and feeds back which quickly
      leads to even more drift from the original training 
      data. If we had lots of data in the lane during training,
      it doesn't take very much to have 
      compounding errors and instability. The controller would
      have no idea what to do once it's away from 
      the training data. 
      This is the problem of distribution shift. 
    </p>

    It's called distribution shift, because
    the training distribution (which was along the lane)
    is very different from the closed-loop, on-policy
    distribution.

  <subsection id="8.1"><h1>Solutions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Teacher forcing</li>
      Similar to dagger's algorithm; Dagger added the 
      analysis.

      <p>
        Keep the demonstrator in the 
        loop as you start giving control to the policy.
        There's a a knob from alpha goes from 0 to 1. 
        In the beginning it's completely driven by the human 
        and 0 on the controller.
        We start slowly moving the knob, taking the training 
        wheels off and letting the controller drive as
        opposed to just immediately stopping the demonstrations 
        and starting the policy drive. 
      </p>      

      If we can keep the training wheels on then 
      we'll start to get data that is off the original
      from the human-only demonstrations. 
      As the trained policy 
      pulls away from the target track, the human will
      pull it back. This helps broaden the distribution and 
      similarly as the policy gets
      trained off the nominal trajectory it will become 
      a stable system and will tend to stay close to the 
      original data.    

      <p>
        In Dagger's algorithm which stands for data aggregation,
        Drew gave some nice analysis. If we assume there is an 
        $\epsilon$ error in the policy then we get cascading 
        errors. We get something that grows at least the
        squared of the time horizon and we can by just feeding 
        back in extra supervisory data (from the human)
        on the bad data (the one that drifts away), we can
        add that into the system to aggregate and thus
        remedy this basic problem.        
      </p>

      <li>Data augmentation</li>
      Nvidia did this famously for autonomous driving. 
      They had cameras facing off to the left 
      and to the right. 
      They could make real data that looked like 
      it was a little off in the wrong direction and they
      basically said the human told me to drive like this but 
      I'm going to augment my data
      with a simple corrective policy that if i had 
      halucinated that i was off the trajectory, I would have
      taken the simple stabilizing controller that would have 
      gotten me back to the human-based data.

      <p>
        With a little data-augmentation, RL works very well.
        Whilst pushing an object around, we can add
        noise perturbations to the pose and in the very 
        next frame, go back to the nominal trajectory the
        box should take.
      </p>

      <li>DART (Laskey '17)</li>
      Add noise directly to the demonstrator/ the 
      supervisory signal i.e. to their action.
      And if we get enough data, this method can solve
      the problem.

      <p>
        <li>Forecasting models</li>
        Don't just predict the next step in the trajectory
        but an entire rollout.
      </p>
    </ul>

    All these methods make incredible demos 
    but can we make it robust enough to work for a real system.

<section id="9"><h1>Case study of BC</h1>
  pete and lucas used the same deep network front 
  end. There are lots of different ways in which people 
  choose the output of the deep network
  perception part $z$ to put into a small policy $\pi$. 
  Pete and lucas chose to use dense descriptors 
  as the representation $z$ to feed into
  their policy. 
  
  <p>
    They asked the question how does this method
    perform compared to some other choices for $z$ based on 
    auto encoders or other kinds of representations.  
  </p>

  <div class="container">

      <figcaption>
        Pete & Lucas' method of using a small set of dense
        descriptors
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 

  <i>Dense descriptors</i> refers to:
  if $d = 3$, then we can draw/render the 
  descriptors of the object as colours.
  We can the pick some small number of random values in
  the dense descriptor space and try to find at runtime 
  the closest points in the current image to those values. 
  We then give the xyz location of these
  dense descriptors into the policy. We can think of this as an 
  unsupervised form of key points. 

  <p>
    [Q]They did tests like pushing and flipping-up a box.
    They tele-op'd using a mouse on 
    the real robot. In sim, they actually wrote a simple
    controller and just tried to clone from a hand 
    designed controller into the neural network as a form of a 
    unit test just to make sure all the cloning and the
    dense descriptors were working.
  </p>

  The policy was a small LSTM network (~100 LSTMs).
  The hand-designed controller that pushed/flipped the box
  had some internal state; a notion of was the bot 
  in contact with the box yet or not. It turned out that
  having a small recurrent network actually 
  outperformed the non-recurrent versions
</section>

<section id="10"><h1>Multi-modal demonstrations</h1>
  In the simplest model, we have: $u = \pi(y)$.
  We'd like the policy/controller to be perfect, i.e.
  there are no 2 optimal actions for a given sensory input.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/26_multiModal.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Multiple optimal solutions
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>   
  Even if we used an optimal controller, there is not
  always a unique answer.
  At different times, if a demonstrator made slightly 
  different decisions with a robot for the same input,
  then we'd have an optimization problem where we're trying 
  to fit a function to something that's not described by a 
  function (pink in the figure).
  This is the problem of having <i>multimodal
  demonstrations</i>  

  <subsection id="10.0"><h1>Solutions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Have the NN output a full multi-modal distribution
      </li>
      For instance, a mixture of gaussians. It becomes a 
      harder optimization problem but
      if the policy can output a full distribution,
      then we can hopefully capture the full multimodal 
      demonstration.

      <p>
        <li>Implicit behaviour cloning</li>
        Instead of $u=\pi(y)$, use Yann Lecun style
        energy-based methods, $u=argmin_{u'}E(u',y)$. 
        $E$ is energy. We learn a function that we have 
        to optimise 
        in order to make our control decision.
        (Has code example in paper, Pete Coral - 
        Pushing peg into hole demos. Not sure what
        it means to have a sharp discontinuity in this
        particular demo). A smal corrective nudge/corrective
        action by the controller can have a huge impact
        on the policy.

        <p>
          Having multiple solutions can really wreak 
          havoc on existing supervised learning pipelines.

<section id="11"><h1>BC is only as good as its demonstrators</h1>
  First BC papers argued differently. They 
  said that because of a robot's steady hand, we filter 
  noise, we have no feedback, the robot can be better 
  than the demonstrator. That's only slightly true.
  People feel the major bottleneck is the
  quality of their demonstrations. This is a 
  major motivation for inverse optimal control to 
  say somehow
  that BC is doing the dumb thing (i.e.
  trying to copy the demonstrator without any understanding
  of its intent). If we can extract a higher level
  meaning from demonstrations and put it through a 
  planner, we can potentially do much better. 
  These things produce amazing demos
  but they really can be very narrow demos.
</section>
 
<section id="12"><h1>Generalisation</h1>
  The big question is what features to select 
  to put in or out in order to get a broader generalization.
  A lot of
  times demos work incredibly well inside the training data 
  but fails as soon as it goes off the training data.  

  <subsection id="12.0"><h1>Where do we get training data from?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Invert time</li>
      Takes a long time to place objects in a box and train
      careful assemblies.
      Disassemble (similar to clutter clearing, we don't
      really care about the end pose of the object and
      hence it's an easier task), then 
      invert time to get the assembly
      process, then train (supervised learning) on 
      the assembly process.

      <p>
        <li>Learning from play</li>
        Humans make goal oriented choices.
        So even random play is useful since they're
        very goal oriented and hence we get a 
        broad distribution.

<section id="13"><h1>How does BC fit with force/impedance control</h1>
  The output of the NN is $u$.
  
  <p>
    In most tasks, people choose for instance
    an end effector velocity or end effector position as $u$.
    That means differential IK or an impedance 
    controller is run on top of that.
    It's rare that people try to output torques from the NN.
    A clever controller like an impedance or a force controller
    is often built as the next stage.
    If the task was assembly or welding or handwriting,
    a force or stiffness control would be used.
    BC does not replace the low level mechanics
    and (high gain?) feedback control,
    but it can send very interesting rich
    commands to the controller.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="14"><h1>Summary</h1>
  BC is a clever way to separate out the 2 questions:
  <ul>
    <li>How to train the weights of the NN</li>
    <li>How to represent the policy sufficiently to do 
      incredible tasks</li>
  </ul>
  
  In the last few years people have had
  incredible results of NNs
  solving really hard dexterous tasks from vision. We've 
  made a lot of progress in understanding
  the representational power of these controllers. The 
  big question now is if we don't
  have everybody doing training demonstrations, how do 
  we train these controllers? The RL approach?
