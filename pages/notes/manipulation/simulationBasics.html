  The main focus is on the physics engine piece of the simulation. The following makes simulating contact for manipulation challenging: 
  <ul>
    <li>Stiff differential equations</li>
    Stiffness is under our control. We need to understand where it comes from, how it manifests itself in simulations and how to deal with it when things go wrong.
  </ul>

    Equation of damped oscillator:
    $$
    \underbrace{m}_{\text{Mass} \atop \text{matrix}}\ddot{q} + 
    \underbrace{b}_{\scriptsize \text{Damping}}\dot{q} + 
    \underbrace{k}_{\text{Spring} \atop \text{stiffness}}q = 0
    $$

    $q$ is the position.

    <p>
      The physical intuition for the damper is that it pulls energy out of the system. Example, friction. Here, the mass wants to oscillate because of the spring but it's going to slow down because of
      the damper.
    </p>

    How do we simulate a simple system like this, accurately.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.1"><h1>Differential equations</h1>
    A differential equation way to think about the system is to write the equations of motion in the state-space form:

    $$\begin{align*}
      x &= \begin{bmatrix}
            q \\ \dot{q}
          \end{bmatrix} \\
      \dot{x} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                    \dot{q} \\
                    \frac{1}{m}(-b\dot{q} - k{q})
                \end{bmatrix} \\
              &= Ax \\

      A &= \begin{bmatrix}
            0 & 1 \\
            -\frac{k}{m} & -\frac{b}{m}
          \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}$$
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection id="1.2"><h1>Stability analysis</h1>
    For the MSD continuous time system, what are the stability properties given a change in the parameters $m, b, k$? If we start at some initial position and velocity as shown in the figure, and let go, does the mass go back and forth about position 0 and come to rest or is it going to do something different. Is the limit of the position as time goes to $\infty$ equal to 0?

    $$
      \lim_{t \to \infty} q(t) = 0 \text{?}
    $$

    <p>
       The system is stable as long as the parameters are all greater than 0. The damping needs to be strictly greater than 0, so that the system is actually decaying and not oscillating forever. Mass cannot be not greater than 0.
    </p>

    The way we can confidently tell whether our parameters will be greater than 0 and hence whether the system is a stable one or not, is by taking the eigen values of the $A$ matrix.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.3"><h1>Numerical integration</h1>
    To integrate a continuous time equation forward i.e. advance this simulator, we make a discrete time approximation.

    $$
      x[n+1] = x[n] + 
      \underbrace{h}_{\text{Time step} > 0}
      \underbrace{Ax[n]}_{\dot{x}}
    $$

    This is a particular kind of integration called <i>Forward euler integration</i>. If one cares about the linear analysis, the above equation can be written as:

    $$
      x[n+1] = (I + hA)x[n]
    $$

    This is a different linear dynamical system and we can ask the following fundamental questions related to numerical analysis:
    <ul>
      <li>Is the system stable or not</li>
      As $n$ goes to $\infty$, does $x$ go to $0$?

      <li>
        For different values of $h$, how accurately can we simulate the true solution from above differential equation
      </li>
    </ul>

    The answer is subtle. The eigen values are messier than we would like. So we opt to do it numerically. One of the great things about linear dynamical systems is that we can integrate them perfectly in closed form. So we can compare the analytical solution (will have no numerical
    integration accuracies) with the solution obtained through numerical approximation (using Euler integration) and ask how similar they are.

    <p>
      The integration method takes the derivative at each time and then forecasts that out as if it was constant; so it's going to make an approximation of the analytical solution. As we increase $h$, i.e. take bigger time steps, the accuracy of the approximation is going to decrease until it gets very bad. 
    </p>

    So it is possible to artificially enforce a system whose continuous time dynamics are stable, to have a discrete time approximation that is unstable by having a very large time step in simulation.    

    <p>
      In particular what matters is the time step $h$ relative to the acceleration $\ddot{q} \sim \frac{k}{m}$. If the stiffness increases, the derivatives are going to get larger. Taking a long time step with fast changing derivatives can quickly lead to big errors. If the accelerations are big, we need to take small time steps to simulate the system accurately. 
    </p>

    To simulate a heavy humanoid that is generating relatively big forces on the ground is easier since big forces on big robot generates relatively low accelerations. If the humanoid were to pick up a toothpick, this is a bad case since it's generating big forces on a little mass. This could lead to the toothpicks flying off in simulation.

    <p>
      One of the challenges in simulating manipulation is that we have to deal with a range of inertias. We tend to have very stiff equations and also the accuracy of the contact simulation is such that we need to choose $k$ larger than we would for walking. 
    </p>

    Having a stiff differential equation means that we have large accelerations resulting in having to use small time steps to simulate accurately.

    <div class="container">

    </div>
    
    To understand the integration of this MSD system, we could plot $q$ as a function of time. We would expect to see an oscillation that decays if it's stable or blow up if it's unstable. But, to see the long term behaviour of the system, it would be clearer to do a phase plot i.e. $q$ versus $\dot{q}$.    

    <p>
      As the stiffness $k$ gets bigger, the phase portrait becomes more elongated i.e. we get larger velocities.
    </p>

so we're going to see now where some of that stiffness comes from in the contact problem
let's do a little contact mechanics
I'm going to take almost the same example but I'm going to put a contact inside it okay in fact I'll I'll do it
in the vertical plane this time instead of the horizontal plane just so I'm pulling down
with mg okay and I've got a ground here and I want to think about
what happens if my my point Mass goes into the ground now your physical intuition will
probably tell you all kinds of things about that um first of all you probably expect it to bounce
but that will depend on our contact parameters some of the models that we're going to talk about it's actually going to go and stop depends what you if you assume
that the ground and the point are infinitely rigid then actually unless you do something else to model
restitution or something like this then actually rigid contact would have it defined as just coming into
losing all of its energy on collision and so most of our models most of our
mathematical models are actually rigid geometries so so the default answer
actually is stop but we'll see ways to make that better okay so this is almost the same
equations but I don't have damping now I just have if I call this now the Z
m z double dot is just negative uh mg
is when I'm in the air but then once I get into the ground I'm going to have a
contact force let me call it the normal force for now but we're going to use our full
spatial notation after the basic example okay so when it's on the ground
I'll have this force of normal and I'll have the mg both
okay so then in this case how my equations look like this
like I said you might expect it to bounce but we'll see the cases where it's it's not so the question is where does f n come
from when it's at rest you could sort of Imagine That FN will be negative mg and
you'll have an equilibrium but it's more interesting to ask what happens when you when you collide
okay so option one
is rigid contact
meaning we've assumed both objects are perfectly rigid to like steel
objects you know colliding like this right even harder than steel right because
steel would bounce a little bit right um so the way that FN is defined in the
perfectly rigid case FN is the smallest Force
that resists penetration
it's the principle of least action if you want the variational version
right so the this represents a constraint and the forces of constraint
in the principle of least action which is a mechanics principle are that the constraint forces are the minimal forces
they need to be in order to they make the minimal change to the unconstrained
motion as possible now what is that what does that Force
have to be what is the minimal Force at the moment of impact is the interesting case
anybody know the answer I don't even have to tell you what m is you can tell me the answer
at the moment of impact FN has to be infinite
okay why so if I were to plot
the function of T let's say Z Dot let me just simulate for it I'm going to
a version of this of my my pot here so Z dot is just going to increase
it's going to get more and more negative until the moment of collision this is the
and then in the perfect rigid model
Z dot is going to suddenly be zero okay so in an in an Impulse I went from
having a negative velocity to having a zero velocity and that requires an
impulsive Force
a Delta function in force okay which does it has finite work but over an
infinitely small interval so it's it's actually a Delta function yes discreet timer
yes simulation good that's exactly the the question so so this is in the perfectly continuous
time case and the question was what happens if I now do my Euler integration if I only ask that the penetration is
satisfied at the finite time steps of my integration which is all I tend to ask
then yes you can have a finite force that resists and gets you perfectly back
okay so I was going to say that later but I'll say that now that's good
um let me let me introduce one bit of notation to say that carefully
so we'll there's one other quantity that we're going to use generally here which is the sine distance function
this is just the sine distance function we used in perception right this is the distance between the object and the
other object that I'm trying to collide right so this is the smallest force that
resists penetration resisting penetration means that Phi of Q stays greater than equal to zero
okay yeah and I think um I guess I don't I don't need it yeah so
for Euler integration
if we only require
V Q at certain n to be greater than equal to zero right
at discrete times
then FN can be finite
that's a little unfortunate there's two ends there
yeah and in that case it has the it's still we think of it as an impulsive Force integrated over the some finite
time so it has a finite magnitude
is that clear yeah how about I guess good
most of you aren't giving me any thumbs but that's okay I know it's a little strange
okay so but but this notion of rigid unrigid contact
which most of our mechanics is rigid body mechanics leads to this seeming problem where I
need instantaneous forces and collision which makes makes it hard to simulate
accurately you could if you want to simulate and continue you know as accurately as possible in continuous time you actually have to do event
detection and you have to handle the that Collision event explicitly and then continue integrating
if you make a discrete time approximation then we can we're going to play different tricks
so let's just before we move on to those time steppers let me also say option two here
is to think about soft contact
so now when the ball is on the ground here
I'm actually gonna let me draw it even a little bit in penetration here
I'll I'll make instead a spring law that governs
I can make it bigger you guys are far away I've got a ball that's way under the ground
right and let me put a spring that's trying to Define
my normal force that would be an alternative and I can do a spring damper in fact that's more
practical to do a spring damper and in fact another good way to define
the normal force here would be to say it's zero if V Q
is greater than zero and it's negative
VQ times k if V Q
Plus or equal to zero
and then we could we could add damping into for instance
foreign this is actually I would say a better model of what
really happens in the world than the rigid objects no objects are technically rigid
but the stiffness of real collisions
because it says to simulate accurate things that don't penetrate much like imperceptibly right you're when I'm when
my foot's hitting the ground there's a small deformation of my skin right but but not a big deformation which means in
order to model that accurately I have to choose K to be very big and this is the tension right so so now
I have I can add stiffness in my contact model but it makes means I have to simulate slowly
right even worse the the simulation is changing the the stiffness of the
simulation in some sense is changing as a function of the of the configuration so in my plot it's hard to pick one time
step that will work in all of the regions because the stiffness values are different in different regions
if I have two objects if I get an object jammed between multiple objects for you know that's a different configuration it's much harder to pick a single h
that works for all the possible derivatives you're going to get across the states
okay so we in practice you'll pick K enough to you know visually
be satisfying you won't see I mean when we debugged we were first debugging Atlas we would have Atlas like fall a
meter into the ground just to make sure that we got you know the time steps right and stuff like this and then we would slowly make it tune that up
okay and then I should have said but when in the when I make H small it takes longer to
simulate right I have to if I want to simulate for five seconds and my time step is small it's going to take a long time to simulate so this is the tension
how accurate do you want your physics to be how large do you want K to be versus how
fast you want to simulate sorry okay good
is that clear the basic basic story okay so let's think now about
friction we've only talked about horizontal force or sorry vertical Force so far in the
where vertical is always defined in this in this Frame
as the direction the the gradient of the sine distance function so I'll say that
more carefully but um in the ball falling from the sky it's the normal force is always vertical
but for any two objects as they're coming together the normal direction is the
the place of it's the direction of closest distance minimal distance
okay that's the generalization think about what friction looks like
in the simple case let me now throw a ball sideways at the ground okay
and when I get to the ground I'm going to have not my blue again I don't know
it's blue I always break blue yeah you guys are not going to be able to see blue okay
that's my normal force and I'm going to call this my tangential Force here okay
we came up with um two ways to possibly Define a normal force
loads of details behind them but the general idea is either the the whatever force is required to completely resist
penetration or a spring Force to go like this but we haven't said anything about
slowing me down if I'm sliding along the ground okay and the rigid approximation of
friction is most famously cool in friction
which says again it's a dissipation law which says that my my
um my frictional force my tangential force
is less than or equal to the some coefficient of friction times my
normal force
and inside that limit then it's going to be the um
the smallest Force
that resists sliding
okay and then once you're sliding and so this is sticking
and then once you're sliding when you have a velocity at the at the interface
that's greater than zero then it's the maximal dissipation
it's it's the force that has magnitude mu FN that dissipates the most energy
that just tells me what direction the force should be applied the magnitude is going to be based on my normal force and
the direction is the whatever direction would slow me down the most
okay this is kind of a strange thing but but the coulomb friction law
just says that if my object is if I have a larger normal force if I push down
harder on my object then it's going to resist it's going to provide more friction and it's proportionally more and that I can
summarize that friction interaction with this single coefficient
okay in 2D what does this look like
this is this is saying I say it's greater than you know I've got an absolute value of the normal force is is
proportional to my the absolute value of the tangential force is proportional to my normal force
that means as my normal force grows I can get more tangential Force and the way that we draw this you could
draw this as a the admissible frictions here
live in a cone right as the normal force increases then I can have larger tangential forces
anything inside this region here and this is called the friction cone
foreign this definition still works in 3D
the friction cone now becomes an ice cream cone in 3D it still describes a limit on the total
amount of frictional force based on the normal force
Okay so what happens here then so when I said these things quickly it's the smallest
force that resists sliding and then it's the maximal dissipation so if you think about a simple case for instance
of my ball or let me make it a box so we don't think about the rolling
version of it okay on an inclined plane
then I'll have normal forces that live inside some friction cone I'll
summarize the contact at these two points for now
I could even I can say there's little little points of contact here and the rest is suspended a little bit
foreign okay so I'm allowed to have any Force inside the friction cone
so what happens now if I have mg pulling me down like this
and I have a friction that's trying a frictional force that has to live inside this cone
right that's trying to push up and it's going to pick the maximal direction it can pick up
my my artwork I think actually I had forgotten to make this carefully but I
did make the both of those red lines are consistently slanted so given this
beautiful rendition here there is no Force
that can be applied at these points that would perfectly resist gravity so
this is this object is going to slide if my friction cone was if my mu was
larger my friction cone could increase there's a you see the geometric picture I'm trying to say there's a in order to
get force balance I would need a force of friction that's perfectly resisting gravity
since this is outside my friction cone in that picture that means that thing's going to slide if I were to increase the friction cone
by increasing mu then I could get inside that or if I were to decrease the ramp
I could get inside that okay but there's actually a beautiful geometric version of friction in that
picture okay ask ask some questions is this
Landing is this a useful level of detail no that's fine yeah
yes
exactly so if my if I were to make a free body diagram which I'm doing here right and I said I wanted the forces to
balance then in order for the forces to balance the forces of contact would have to be able to be equal and opposite to
the force of gravity and because that is not an acceptable friction Force
that means that it would slide and in fact the friction Force you would get would be on this line
resisting as much as possible that's the maximal dissipation idea resisting as
much as possible but ultimately still not stopping it from sliding
what else can I say to help
friction cone idea is going to come up over and over again you can't talk about manipulation without the you know saying
friction cone so you don't have to understand all the details about it but
the concept of a friction cone is essential yes
the forces will always be inside the cone that's the the rule and they and
if I want this brick to stay still then I would want the friction the force to the friction cone to have a force inside
it that could resist that gravity yeah
is this like arbitrary the way you do the code or is it based off of like
good good good good question so the normal is um is defined
it turns out in the general case it's defined by the direction in which the distance is smallest in this picture
it's totally reasonable I'm going to use the same color as here is to say that the normal
FN was here the tangent
is a core is a coordinate system that is on the surface yeah when it's a
two-dimensional surface we have to pick a coordinate system for those tangents and so therefore the tangent in red
is in this direction it's normal
so that's what defined the geometry of that cone the angle there is given by
the coefficient of friction I have a picture actually of the coordinate systems
somewhere here okay so in general I have two general
objects I defined the sign distance between those objects with this the normal is always the direction of that
sign distance the gradient of the sign distance it turns out and the tangent is some Choice like this
in I tried to do a 3D picture I hope that is sort of clear you could
pick any coordinate system on that surface and then you'll design a cone so it would look like an ice cream cone
uh in that with the normal in the middle of the cone
sliding friction is cool too but I'm not sure if you have the appetite yeah
so uh there's actually no top so the this law of friction
which is not a great law honestly it's the best we've got but it has problems um
I can actually I'll tell you the problem in a second here but um this says if you give me more normal force I will give
you more friction there's no limit yeah okay here's here's a reason why
it's bad and this is why rigid contact is actually bad Here's a thought experiment let me just
so imagine I have a table with four legs
okay and all I know all of the equations of motion would tell me is that if I if I
walk up to a table that's standing still then the normal forces must be sufficient to balance the force of
gravity so I know that there's a sum of normal forces that cancels gravity
even more I actually know that those forces have to resist the torque any torques due to gravity
but I've got four feet and I could produce the necessary torque with any balance and with only three
feet that means that the rules of mechanics don't actually tell me how much normal
force is in each feed it's a It's like a just a failing of our of our rules of
rigid mechanics okay so I could have I could take some normal force over here and put it over here and still get a valid solution to the equations
everything I've said here does not completely define what FN is here's the problem now
so if you go to push the table some of those feet might be in sticking
some of them might be in sliding depending on the normal force you don't know what the friction force is
so the the rules of rigid body mechanics will not tell me if the table goes straight or turns or left or right all
of them are possible solutions given the governing equations they do not give me a unique solution to the differential
equations I generate that seems totally embarrassing right we have like
so much smarts and mechanics but we can't tell you which way the table is going to go we would need a like atom
level simulation of the differences of the actual contacts or whatever to we need more than a point model of contact
at each feet to resolve that ambiguity I can write down a perfectly reasonable set of equations and it has non-unique
Solutions yes
yep that's a different thing well first of
all that's probably not good for your felt table right but uh like if my kids were doing that I would yell at them um
you're saying you push down and then it squirts out yeah I think if you push down perfectly with absolute normal
force it wouldn't Square it out you're putting a large force and you're accidentally putting a little bit on the side and uh and it'll go out yeah
done in that box diagram if we put oil on that yep
yes that's exactly if I were to change the the slipperiness that is this coefficient of friction the cones will
come in and I will more likely slide it's exactly the right intuition now the interesting thing is that the
coefficient of friction is really a property of the interaction between the two
types of materials so you can't say this object this mustard bottle has coefficient of
friction three it's when the mustard pairs with the steel table it has a certain coefficient
it's in contact pairs right so it's a little Annoying to specify and people
typically specify individual numbers for individual ones and come up with a hacky way to combine them uh in in the
simulator yes I am going to not yet not yet this is
but this is exactly right so I summarized that's why you heard me hemenha about I just drew the forces
there but really there should be a forces distributed potentially across that entire thing
um but most simulators don't do that so let's actually talk about that so so
um sliding friction is awesome but I'm going to skip it
but basic yeah I mean there's a there's a different uh you know the rules of governing what force you'll get when you
do start sliding are have a similar rules typically it's it's basically it's
almost exactly the same with maximal dissipation but most of the time people will say that your mu decreases once you
start sliding you'll have a different coefficient of sliding friction then static friction
so just if you see mu static or mu Dynamic that just means once you start moving
we have a different coefficient of friction and that is uh you know it shouldn't be that way right
that's just like our equations aren't quite right and we're going to cover it up by saying there's two numbers there and they discontinuously interact uh
it's just weird but this is our best rigid approximation
okay so um so now you I think you appreciate a little bit more this notion of contact
forces how they need to be big potentially so for instance
this was back in the day when we were competing to win Atlas and this was in
gazebo um right and the we didn't get to pick the parameters
of the simulator right um and it was really annoying to walk over the rough terrain because
it would go like this right um so one of two things should have happened
at this point if we had control of the simulator we would have changed the stiffness of the ground down
and admitted that it would sink in a little bit or we would have turned the time step down
right when you start seeing artifacts like that that means you're getting into the regime where your integrator is not
accurately tracking there's a few other ways that you could get that artifact and I'll tell you but but that's getting into the regime where
your your integrator is not tracking the true Dynamics and your first instinct should be to turn the time step down
your second Instinct should be to start looking for where the stiffness in your differential equation is coming from
ironically in the first demo this is the Ewa moving around and picking up the block
I had to pick a certain stiffness time step right and I wanted it to run well in deep node and all these things the
thing the place where the stiffness comes from I think you'll never guess
there's just a even moving around with a little red block any guess where's what's the stiff part
of the differential equation in that system I've set you up to say it's the red block it's not the red block
it's the fingers it turns out the way that we simulate the the wsg I guess I
did say it maybe a little bit but that was that excellent but um yeah the the wsg has a mechanical
drive so that the two fingers are always equal and opposite magnitude we simulate
that with a stiff spring two stiff spring like it has to be stiff but it's this it's the thing that drives
the bottleneck of my simulator that's annoying okay but at least I know it I found it
and I know that if I want to make my simulator faster I can change that number or handle that in that stiffness
properly okay let's think about the the question
of surfaces right so you so um we had a question now that why did I draw two arrows when I really should be
thinking about integrating over the surface it's a pretty subtle thing
so most simulators think about Force vectors
applied at points that's the natural thing to think about when you're writing a Dynamics engine
but it gets subtle fast so let's just think about box on box contact
that's what we saw when I dropped a bunch of red boxes out of the sky right
so let's say I've got I've got one box and I've got another box here okay box one and box two
where do I draw the contact forces my normal forces right I drew them here and here to make my
free body diagram work but that was a little arbitrary you might think if you're writing the
simulator that you'd think oh I'll just pick the corners but that's not robust enough to handle
all the cases right so what where are you going to pick them if you find yourself in a situation where your box is hanging off the end
right the points of maybe I need to somehow pick here
and pick here for instance would be a reasonable choice
but there's another you know there's other cases too so because the integration time step isn't perfect and
I might not simulate the the equations perfectly I might find myself
with my block like this it you know my integration wasn't
perfect so my geometries are overlapping a little bit now where do you draw the contact forces
right it's not super clear right maybe you pick here maybe you pick here
writing an algorithm that picks those forces consistently is hard maybe impossible I don't know I
think it has never been done and this is another big reason why simulators of contact become unstable
is you'll be you'll be simulating along you'll take steps of the integration and it will quickly change its mind about
where the forces should be applied and then all of a sudden something will explode okay
that could be what happened it was happening here too was that it could be slightly changing its mind about where the forces should be applied
so um yeah so here's a here's a a reasonable candidate right so
let's say I've got two boxes that are in penetration I think a natural algorithm that I would
try to write would say I'm going to pick the point of maximal penetration and then I'm going to take the closest
exit from that maximal penetration and I'm going to apply a force like that
okay so that's a pretty good algorithm yeah but if I start looking at the way
that Force gets applied as I move the objects through there's a problem which is that the
location of the force changes discontinuously as I move across that corner
so in particular this this notion of penetration distance and closest exit
has the property that if I'm going in and I cross this corner a force that was
previously pushing me in this direction my normal force all of a sudden tried to decide me push push up in this direction
since I'm into penetration it could be a large force that suddenly changed Direction this is another big source of
stiffness or or instability in the differential equations in in the contact equations
okay take a quick stretch and then I'll tell you how to solve that problem
thank you
my blue shot
okay I'm gonna solve it because we only have a little a little bit of time left
so the I think the this really is a big source of of errors
and a lot of simulations I think the answer in some sense was in your question why not integrate over the
surface right the answer has just been it's computationally expensive and hard to do that computational geometry
but one of the things that has made the simulation engine and Drake much more robust now is by we're doing that extra
work to integrate over the surface so um but okay a first trick which actually
we use a lot is to just um if you and you could put this in any simulator you certainly put
it in in Drake we often actually put extra contact geometries down so for
that red brick to fall and land in the piles and and be accurate in all the different cases
if you look at the if you visualize the Collision geometry instead of the visual geometry you'll actually see that the
red box has a little box just in set just partly inset from the original box and then there's
for there's zero radius spheres at all of the corners
why I'm telling the simulator do your best in all these hard places to pick
one point to um you know one point to summarize the force but go ahead and
put an extra point at the corners always do that I'm saying there's an extra so we get one contact force per Collision
geometry pair so by having extra points declared to the side I'm just saying always pick the
corners and then do your best on the interior when we're simulating with Point contact that actually works
surprisingly well even in these sort of cases um like the the bricks falling down like
this if you watch carefully this is actually only simulating with Point contact and it I had to convince myself like
every one of those cases is actually resisting penetration because some corner is hitting some that
other interior that slightly inset box right or the points on points so it's a
very good heuristic that makes these you know these things work pretty well even if like grippers picking up the box in the middle it's all you know that that
has worked very well so if you just want to use a Point contact based simulator better then you can help by just making
the Collision geometry a little bit more friendly okay but you can also do this harder thing of trying to to
um do the surface integrals how does that work okay so this is
called in Drake it's called hydroelastic Contact so it turns out the rules of physics across a surface in
3D of arbitrary geometry they're not in a textbook we had to invent some that sounds bad
but uh wait we took our best extension of the existing laws of physics across
the surface and we applied them in this in this way but it required first a bunch of computational geometry
which you take meshes intersecting with other meshes and you compute volumetric meshes on the Fly of the
intersection and then you try to take a surface inside that mesh which summarizes the
Collision boundary and you take an integral across that surface mesh and you apply forces in a
proportion across that whole surface integral and that has made a huge difference in the way that we do
simulation you get these beautiful simulations that if you turn on all of the hydroelastic
visualization you'll get you'll see the rich contact geometry moving around
if you take the box on box Collision right where it was changing discontinuously before now we get
beautiful smooth changing and contact forces
just to show the before and after here right that is a salute it's an expensive
solution to the problem but that is a robust solution to the problem
okay there's a lot of computational geometry work behind that and I want to be clear so the the model
that we have going on here now is actually uh in most of the cases when I
say it's soft on soft for instance that would be the spring like model so we have a stiffness
in these hydroelastic simulations the object is not deforming
you can do fully deformable simulation too this is a nearly rigid simulation
we're allowing penetration so the contact geometry doesn't change but on every instant we're allowing the
penetration and we're Computing an integral over the penetration to present the force so this is good for soft
simulation in the low deformation mode if you can say my geometry is roughly not changing
but I want it to be squishy a little bit this is a good model for that right or for a nearly rigid if I turn K up on my
stiffness I can simulate very pretty nearly rigid things with this okay it's not going to simulate a plush toy if you
want to pick up a you know a plush toy and shake it around or a rope or a cloth this is not the right model for that
that's what it means when I said State space for simulation and planning is the original rigid body State it's not
adding state to track the shape of the surface
friction in hydroelastic again is uh I mean it's applied in a similar way
sliding friction is even more subtle but it required taking our best approximation of coolant
friction on that on that surface right so it it's in the paper there's a lot of
details but it's uh it's a it's a almost cool and frictiony
so it's more expensive than Point contact but less expensive than finite element for instance
so you get these great simulations then if you watch the hand pick up the mug and you turn off the hand visualization
and just show the the hydroelastic regions you know this is what turned it
into a really robust simulation this is one of the things yeah
the other thing is a really good contact solver so that we're not doing Euler
integration we're actually doing a much more advanced integration scheme inside inside Drake
the if there are demo reels from the teams that are working in this are hilarious they always just have random
objects falling and uh they always look beautiful and are doing more advanced things but
this week it was green peppers falling out of the sky and this is now a green pepper
in a bowl that almost falls off a table but not right and the contact forces are being
visualized what's really amazing is if you watch the surface contact surface changing
even between the bowl and the table it's the little lip of the bowl right and that's so subtle to get that right
and if you want to measure the happiness of a Dynamics expert the the measure is
how constant how smooth are those contact forces moving right if you
there's some really fun situations I think I've got a Lego example here somewhere yeah we put Legos on right we're mating Legos
and the contact forces came out like this and were just like a rock solid and I think that that was you know ecstasy
for the Dynamics Team that was like did you see what our contact force engine just did you know because normally you'd
be like like this right um in a lot of so a lot of the a lot of
simulators will use this blocks falling from the sky as kind of a demo reel right of a very advanced
simulations but it's a kind of a trick right because you can't look at that and judge if it's
physically accurate or not in practice if you were to zoom in you'd see objects intersecting all the time because what they do when they're
simulating that is they they say I've got like 10 000 contacts happening
I'm going to pick 10. I'll make those work this time step and then the next time step I'll pick another 10. and that
10 is a magic number right and in net it kind of looks like Things fall and separate and that's all good but it's
not very accurate and the contact forces like you see all over the place and they'd be missing in some places or
whatever you know so this is this is uh the real test is if you can visualize the contact forces and they are just
sitting rock steady then you've got a strong numerical recipe behind it
let me ask yeah
so um okay there's a multi-level response so
the question was why is it important that we allow penetration so fundamentally if we think about a
spring model then there's no contact force until penetration so the first choice is to do that
the alternative to a spring model is to handle the impulsive forces and try to obey those constraints exactly there is
a mode you can try to put one soft thing in with another hard object in hydroelastic that does some of
this work but but right now in this in the simplest version of the model forces are only defined when you're in
penetration that's when you have a surface to work with
yes for the
mug with the hand yeah yeah I mean they're they're we always
aim for real-time simulation um what's that still it's uh it depends on which simulation
and it depends on the number of the mesh test relation of the so you have to take your surface mesh and make it a tet mesh
and the number of finite elements in your tet mesh will cut would be the computational cost so the reason it is not on by default in
Drake is because it's slower but it's it's actionable we use it we choose to turn it on often in our
manipulation workflows yeah yes
right so so the so the question is so what about finite element models Fem
so let's just mention deformable simulation for a second here
so if I wanted to simulate a plush toy or something like this then I might use
a finite element model
which is f e m okay which roughly says I'm gonna I'm gonna
model my um my Stanford bunny plush Stanford Bunny with
a bunch of Springs and spring masses across the the surface of the object and
allow them to compress and shrink and possibly change their relative location because the thing is deformable
fem is just uh computationally optimized version of that to some extent
so the question was can we make finite element real time I think people definitely have and can
GPU is is a big accelerator for fem type models where
um contact is actually not super opt it is not optimized well by GPU because it's
very branchy in the sense of you you take a different path through the code whether you're making contact between
object one and object three or not and that branches so much that the GPU isn't
a huge accelerator but for finite element where you have a whole mesh and you know things are going to be uh you
know there's no branching on that particular mesh then you put it on the finite element and people have very uh
performant simulations so there's an Nvidia simulation of a fingertip with a soft
finger that's running in real time rates yes
so I don't guess it's not not a lot of penetration simulations yeah so so okay then there's
a question of how does the finite element get connected with contact forces and I
think you can use all the same if you treat each of your methods as each of your
elements as either rigid or soft allowing penetration or not I think all of those things can can be handled the
same connections now Drake has fem also it's not on by default either but we do
have a finite element method that's not GPU accelerated yet because it's very hard to release open source code that
will work on everybody's GPU but that's coming um
and uh there's one other one I'll mention but there's a question
yes so this is a great question so um the
recipe of trying to summarize a whole body when you're in penetration with a
single Force is is difficult with a spring Force but if I'm willing to take
forces everywhere then the question is resolved again so I'm actually it's not just a single
normal force that's being applied you could summarize the total forces by putting a point somewhere you know
they're mathematically equivalent but the way it's being computed is by taking an integral over the surface of contact
and so that ambiguity disappears disappears
the other um so finite elements are are good for many for
I've never actually seen anybody shake a standard money but I'm sure they I'm sure there's a paper out there that does that um but let's say I wanted a plush
toy or something um large and soft when you get to like cloth simulation that's an extra level
of complexity because you have to worry a lot about thin objects you can have piercing phenomenon so a small if you
take slightly too big of a Time step you're on the other side or part of your object is on the other side of the object and then so you just have to deal
with sort of these breakthrough events but you can do that again with a finite element method for instance and extra
extra work but we I would say I don't claim that Drake can support cloth yet that'll be a future future work
the other one that that a lot of people are interested in and have been working with is uh mpm material Point methods
particle type simulations
um so if you've seen Nvidia Flex for instance or if you've seen like these
particle simulations where you have something that could be a fluid it could turn into a rigid it can be something in
between this is doing like not quite the atom level but like a you know big molecule
kind of level simulation of these objects and on the GPU it can be made surprisingly performant it's you tend to
give up a lot in terms of um if you tried to simulate a rigid thing
with an npm model you would find big gaps in the modeling but for fluids and
other things you know again if you were to compare it to navier Stokes you'd probably find big gaps but in terms of
like if I just want to see a robot crack an egg and see what that looks like then it's not it's it's I think it's the way
that people have been trending yes foreign
that's why I gave these um optimization principles they give trivial answers in the when
two so let me repeat the question sorry which was I've only said anything about two objects colliding but I can have
cases where uh you know I've got a bunch of objects colliding like in the blocks falling for instance so then how do
these forces get resolved in that so in the dissipation sorry in the penetration with springs it's clear
the interesting part is when I'm doing rigid contact let's say and I'm trying to avoid penetration in a multi-object
setting then you actually you you resolve these forces of smallest force
that resists sliding and maximum dissipation in the multibody equations
with all of them adding constraints and you solve an optimization problem on every time step to resolve the forces
this is these are the time stepping simulators there if you've heard of linear complementarity problems LCP that
is a way to solve this problem it's falling out of favor because it's um it's a bad numerical problem but it's um
yeah that yes we solve an optimization problem on every time step in order to figure out the forces in the general
case great question
Okay so your Wizardry level of uh of using even
just being a user of context emulation I hope got up a little bit there's you saw a little bit of
um what's going on behind the scenes but if you learn if you take away one thing if you see your feet shaking or objects
whatever the first thing you do is you turn down the time step and make sure that phenomenon goes away you
should always be able to take that times that phenomenon Away by making the time steps small enough it just might be painfully slow to simulate
but then what you do is you find the source of stiffness in your equations
figure out why the gripper was tuned with too high of a gain it might be your controller oftentimes a controller will
add stiffness or it might be some contact parameter resolve that stiffness and then crank
your simulation back up to get fast simulation okay and this the you know what makes a
fast simulator is really how big can you make h there's a bit a little bit about how
much you've optimized your multibody code a little bit but the dominant factor is how big of a Time step can you
take and that's a property of of your integrator and your in your equations of
motion good okay I'll see you Thursday
