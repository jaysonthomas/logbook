  <i>Eigenvectors</i> are special vectors that don't get knocked off their span during a linear transformation - they simply get <i>scaled</i> (squished or stretched) along their spans by a constant amount called their corresponding <i>eigen value</i>.
  
  <subsubsection><h1>Use case</h1>
    
  </subsubsection>
  A better way to find what a linear transformation does, that is less dependent on the chosen coordinate system, is to find the eigenvectors and eigenvalues.

  $$
    A\vec{v} = \lambda\vec{v}
  $$

$A$ - matrix representing some transformation.<br>
$\vec{v}$ - eigenvector.<br>
$\lambda$ - scalar value; the corresponding eigenvalue.

<p>
  This expression says that the matrix-vector product (LHS) gives the same result as just scaling the eigenvector (RHS). So finding the eigenvectors and their eigenvalues <n>of a matrix $A$</n> comes down to finding the values of $\vec{v}$ and $\lambda$ that make this expression true.
</p>

We rewrite RHS as a matrix-vector multiplication to match the LHS (instead of being a scalar-vector multiplication). We can only manipulate the equation if both sides are of the same kind. We use a matrix, which has the effect of scaling any vector by a factor of $\lambda$. The columns of such a matrix will represent what happens to each basis vector, and each basis vector is simply times $\lambda$. So this matrix will have the number $\lambda$ down the diagonal with $0$'s everywhere else. The common way to write this is as follows using the identity matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
  \lambda & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \lambda & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & \lambda
\end{bmatrix} 
= \lambda \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 0 & 0 \\
            0 & 1 & 0 \\
            0 & 0 & 1
          \end{bmatrix} 
= \lambda I
$$

$$\begin{align*}
  A\vec{v} &= \lambda\vec{v} \\
  A\vec{v} &= (\lambda I)\vec{v} \\
  (A - \lambda I)\vec{v} &= 0 \\
\end{align*}$$

This expression will always be true if $\vec{v}$ itself is the zero vector, but that's boring. What we want is a non-zero eigenvector.

<p>
  We can treat $(A - \lambda I)$ as a transformation matrix. The only way for the product of a matrix with a non-zero vector to be $0$ is if the transformation associated with that matrix squishes space into a lower dimension. And this squishification corresponds to a zero determinant for the matrix. Using the linear transformation matrix as above as an example:

  $$\begin{align*}
    det(A - \lambda I) &= 0 \\
    det \left( \begin{bmatrix}
      3-\lambda & 1 \\
      0 & 2-\lambda
    \end{bmatrix} \right) &= 0
  \end{align*}$$

  An <a href="https://t.ly/c7PJ">example</a>. As $k$ goes to 3 or 2, the 2D planar area gets squished to a 1D line of a certain length.
</p>



To be concrete, let's say your matrix a has columns (2, 1) and (2, 3),

  Application - to find the axis of rotation. Determinant = 1.
  Does a vector remain on its span or get knocked off.
  Think of stretching or squishing the whole space.

  In linear algebra, a right eigenvector of a square matrix A is a non-zero vector v that satisfies the equation:

Av = λv

where λ is a scalar known as the eigenvalue corresponding to the eigenvector v.

Geometrically, a right eigenvector of a matrix A is a vector that, when multiplied by A, is simply scaled by a factor λ, with the direction of the vector remaining unchanged.

The term "right" refers to the fact that the eigenvector is multiplied on the right-hand side of the matrix A, as opposed to a left eigenvector, which would be multiplied on the left-hand side of A.

Right eigenvectors are important in many areas of mathematics and physics, as they play a fundamental role in the diagonalization of matrices, which is a powerful technique for studying the behavior of linear transformations and systems of linear equations. Additionally, right eigenvectors can be used to decompose a matrix into simpler components, such as a diagonal matrix and a set of eigenvectors.
