<section id="0"><h1>Newton-euler equations</h1>
  The Newton-Euler equations provide a framework for analyzing the motion of rigid bodies in a systematic and mathematical way, taking into account both linear and angular motion. 

  <p>
    These equations come in 2 forms:
    <ul>
      <li>Recursive</li>
      These equations are derived recursively and are useful for efficient computation. They are based on the principle of propagating velocities and accelerations through a kinematic chain. They are often used in the computation of dynamic simulations for robotic systems, where the goal is to calculate the forces and torques experienced by each joint as a result of the motion of the robot.
      
      <p>
        <li>Non-recursive</li>
        These equations are formulated in a non-recursive manner and are sometimes preferred for conceptual clarity and ease of derivation. They express the dynamics of the rigid body directly in terms of its mass, inertia, external forces, and torques.
      </p>
    </ul>

<section id="1"><h1>Moment of inertia</h1>
  SI unit: $kgâ‹…m^2$

  <p>
    Moment of inertia is the resistance of a body to changes in its rotational motion. It is a measure of how hard it is to rotate an object about an axis. The moment of inertia of an object depends on its mass and the <n>distribution of that mass around the axis of rotation</n>.
  </p>
  
  The moment of inertia of a point mass is equal to its mass multiplied by the square of its distance from the axis of rotation. The moment of inertia of a continuous body can be calculated by integrating the moment of inertia of all the point masses that make up the body.

<section id="2"><h1>Parallel axis theorem</h1>
  [<a href="https://t.ly/CHqiq">Ref1</a>, 
  <a href="https://t.ly/hgiRt">Ref2</a>]
  <br>
  Imagine an object on the screen with an axis through its centre of mass, perpendicular to it and pointing outside of the screen. The parallel axis theorem states that the moment of inertia $I$ about any axis parallel to and a distance $d$ away from an axis through the object's center of mass is given by:
  $$
    I = I_{CM} + md^2
  $$
  The mass $m$ is the total mass of the object. $I_{CM}$ is the moment of inertia about the centre of mass.
