<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Dynamics overview</h1>

<section id="0"><h1>Definitions</h1>
  A <i>force</i> is just a <n>push or a pull</n> on an object. It is a vector that has both magnitude and direction. A spinning rotor produces thrust and moment. At <i>equilibrium</i>, forces and moments all balance each other out and sum to zero. There will be some form of acceleration when forces do not balance. 

  <p>
    <i>Dynamics</i> is concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces. In robotics, understanding the dynamics involves understanding:
    <ul>
      <li>What forces are created by rotation of motor(s)</li>
      <li>How do these forces affect the motion of the robot</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <i>Inverse dynamics</i> is the process of calculating the wrench needed to generate a motion given the twist and acceleration.

  <p>
    <i>Forward dynamics</i> is the process of calculating the acceleration given the current twist and the applied wrench.
  </p>
  
  <i>Damping forces</i> are dissipative forces that oppose the motion of an object causing it to lose energy over time.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Aim</h1>
  The steps involved when thinking of the dynamics of an object to create a desired motion are:
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the forces acting on the object and how they affect motion</li>
    <li>Implement a mathematical model of these forces in code</li>
    <li>Use the model to advance the current state of the object</li>
  </ul>

  From a control standpoint, having a good dynamics model of a robot allows one to intelligently influence the output of its actuators by properly setting the inputs. 

  <p>
    The aim is to control the magnitude and direction of the forces created by the actuators. For a quadrotor, it would be the thrust vectors created by the rotors for example.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Common forces</h1>
  <subsection id="2.0"><h1>Gravity</h1>
    The force of (due to) gravity (also called <i>weight</i>) always points straight downwards toward the centre of the earth. Its strength is given by:
    $$
      mg
    $$
    $m$ is the mass of the object. <br>
    $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, which is $~9.81 m/s^2$. This is the rate at which an object will accelerate downwards when it's dropped on earth.

    </div>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="2.1"><h1>Drag</h1>
    <i>Drag</i> is a friction force (due to air resistance) experienced by a body moving through a fluid such as air, caused by the difference in velocity between the vehicle body and the fluid.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="2.2"><h1>Thrust</h1>
    Thrust is the upward force generated by rotors/propellers when they spin to push air downwards.
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Equilibrium (Balanced forces)</h1>
  A vehicle is in a state of <i>translational equilibrium</i> when it is not experiencing any translational acceleration (net force is 0). A <i>translation</i> is any non-rotational motion. So, zero translational acceleration means an object isn't accelerating towards the left or right, up or down and forward or backward.
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Acceleration (Unbalanced forces)</h1>
  <subsection id="4.0"><h1>Linear translational acceleration</h1>
    When an object experiences an unbalanced force, it accelerates in the direction of the net force.

    $$
      F = ma
    $$
    $F$ is the <n>net</n> force acting on the object.<br> 
    $a$ is acceleration measured in an <i>inertial frame</i>, i.e. a reference frame that is not accelerating, like the world frame.

    <p>
      $F$ and $a$ are vectors and can be analysed on a pure direction basis. 
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="4.1"><h1>Rotational acceleration</h1>
    Unbalanced moments cause rotational acceleration.

    $$
      \tau = I \alpha
    $$
    
    $\tau$ is the net torque [used interchangeably with moment] around a given axis. <br>
    $\alpha$ [$\frac{rad}{sec^2}$] is the angular acceleration about the same axis; it gives an indication of how fast the rotational speed is changing. Both are vectors.
    
    <p>
      $I$, the <i>Moment of Inertia</i>, is a measure of how hard it is to change an object's <n>rotational velocity</n> about a particular axis. It can be different for each axis.
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>Making use of dynamics in simulation</h1>
  Steps:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Understand the accelerations and rotational acceleration affecting the system at any given time instant.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use the acceleration to update the associated velocities.
    </li>

    <li>
      Use the velocity to update the associated position.
    </li>
  </ul>

  Mathematically, change is accumulated by numerically approximating the integral, i.e. changes in velocity is approximated and added for a period of time to find the position at the end of the period. 
  
  <p>
    Because, acceleration is integrated twice to understand how it influences the motion (position), most systems are <i>Second order systems</i> or a <i>Double integrator</i>. For such a system, the equations that govern how it evolves with time includes second derivatives. Example: for a vehicle moving in the vertical direction, $F=m\ddot{z}$ just says that forces directly influence the second derivative of position.
