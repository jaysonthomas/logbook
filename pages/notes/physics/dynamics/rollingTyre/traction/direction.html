<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Direction</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  Longitudinal friction force does not strictly follow the direction of motion. Instead, it acts in the direction opposite to the slip (or potential slip) of the tyre's contact patch.

Depending on whether you are speeding up or slowing down, this friction can act either with or against the vehicle's motion.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Acceleration: Friction acts with motion</h1>
  When speeding up, torque is applied to the wheels:
  <ul>
    <li>The Mechanism: The wheel tries to spin faster than the car is moving. This means the tire's contact patch pushes backward against the pavement.</li>
    <li>The Reaction: By Newton's Third Law, the pavement pushes forward on the tire.</li>
    <li>Result: The longitudinal friction force points in the same direction as the vehicle's velocity, propelling it forward.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Braking: Friction acts against motion</h1>
  When slowing down, potentially a wheel is clamped:
  <ul>
    <li>The Mechanism: The wheel tries to spin slower than the car is moving (or lock up entirely). The contact patch tries to slide forward across the pavement.</li>
    <li>The Reaction: The pavement pushes backward on the tire to resist this sliding.</li>
    <li>Result: The longitudinal friction force points in the opposite direction of the vehicle's velocity, slowing it down.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Acceleration</h1>
  When a tire pushes against a road surface:
  <ul>
    <li>If static friction (due to the grip of the contact patch on the road) is not overcome, the tire does not <i>slip</i> (loss of grip). This allows a reaction force, <i>traction force</i>, to push the tire forward - it is the effective force driving the tire forward.</li> 

    <p>
      <li>Traction force acts in the direction of motion.</li>
    </p>

    <li>If a tire begins to slip, the friction involved becomes kinetic friction, which acts opposite to the direction of sliding motion with a lower maximum value than static friction. The car then loses effective traction.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Deceleration</h1>
  When braking, the aim is to allow a tire's contact patch with the road to have a longer period gripping onto each other. This allows the tire to slow down and eventually come to a halt. Traction force is still in the direction of motion.
