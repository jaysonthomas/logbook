<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Work, energy, power</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Virtual work</h1>
  [<a href="https://t.ly/0iqf2">Ref</a>]
  Work is the product of a force acting on an object times the distance that the object moves. When the displacement is infinitesimally small, the work is considered to be virtual.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Work-energy relationship</h1>
  The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object is equal to the change in its kinetic or potential energy. 

  $$
    \Delta{W} = \Delta{E}
  $$

  This equation means that the work done on an object results in a change in its kinetic or potential energy. If positive work is done on an object, its kinetic energy increases, and if negative work is done, its kinetic energy decreases. When lifting an object against gravity, the work done is stored as potential energy in the object.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Law of conservation of energy</h1>
  Energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form to another.
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Power</h1>
  It gives an indication of how quickly work (linear or angular) is being done to rotate or linearly move an object. Or how quickly energy is being <n>transferred</n> to motion. Unit: Watt.

  <ul>
    <li>Angular or rotational power</li>
    $$
      P = \tau \cdot \omega
    $$
    Angular velocity is measured in radians per second. Torque is measured in Newton meters.

    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Consider a spinning object, like a wheel on a car. The torque applied to the wheel determines how quickly it accelerates or decelerates its rotation. A greater torque (more force) applied to the wheel will cause it to accelerate faster, increasing its angular velocity. To measure how quickly energy is being transferred to the spinning wheel, both the torque (force) applied and how quickly the wheel is spinning (angular velocity) is considered. The product of these two factors gives the rotational power â€” how much energy is being transferred per unit of time into the rotation of the wheel.
