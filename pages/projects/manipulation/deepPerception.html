<section id="1"><h1>Limitation of using geometry 
  alone for perception</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>No understanding of what an object is</li>
    It was purely based on points in space (point cloud).
    <ul>
      <li>Double picks</li>
      1 grab might have picked 2 objects. This might not
      be good depending on the application.

      <li>Might pick a heavy object from 1 corner</li>
      If a hammer is picked up from the corner, it might slip 
      out because of a huge wrench. From the geometry alone,
      we have no understanding that there's a heavy object at 
      the end and we should pick it up at the center of mass 
      so we don't get a big moment.
    </ul>
    <p>
      <li>Partial views</li>
      If we don't have enough geometric info in the PC,
      we won't be able to infer what's behind an object.
    </p>

    <li>Depth returns don't work for transparent objects</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section><h1>How does Deep Learning help?</h1>
  To do more effective manipulation, we need to understand 
  what objects are and the properties of objects. 

  <p>
    Deep learning, deep-perception 
    follows a statistical approach. 
    The reason we know to pick up a hammer in the middle 
    is because we've picked up a bunch of things that look 
    like hammers in the image and some of 
    them fell out of the hand and some of them didn't.
    The reason we know the mug should be on the 
    table is because we saw a lot of pictures and the mugs 
    were never up in the air; they were always on the table.
  </p>

  If we can correlate the current perception 
  with enough of past data, then it can be a very 
  strong prior that overcomes some of the limitations. 
  It then does in some mystical magical way capture 
  an understanding/reasoning of the object.

  <p>
    Sometimes, DL is overstated and it doesn't 
    involve deep thinking. But, because perception 
    has started to work so well, it has  
    opened up many possibilities in manipulation. 
    It's interesting to bring ideas from dynamics and 
    control closer to common sense reasoning which then opens 
    control to a much more diverse set of tasks.
  </p>
  
  <subsection><h1>What will be covered</h1>
    Will only focus on 
    parts that are relevant to robotics and manipulation i.e.
    <ul>
      <li>How to generate training data for instance for
        manipulating an object
      </li>
      <li>What kind of questions can we ask a deep network</li>
    </ul>
    We'll only discuss how the tools work but only 
    enough to be able to use them. We won't discuss:
    <ul>
      <li>How to architect them differently - neural 
        architectures (links in the notes)</li>
      <li>Choose different number of layers</li>
    </ul>
  </subsection>
</section>

<section><h1>What questions can we ask of the NN?</h1>
  The input to the NN is RGB images. We could feed in
  the depth channel as well. Some people represent
  the depth info differently and feed it in.
  But, a surprisingly amount of successful work have 
  been done on just RGB.

  <p>
    What are the questions we can ask the deep part of 
    our perception system. We'll start with standard
    computer vision questions and see the kind of loss
    functions people have been successful with.
    We are building up toward being able to train the NN
    to be a pose estimation algorithm so that the NN will
    output a pose.
  </p>

  <div class="container">

      "../../../figures/manipulation/26_questionsWeCanAskOfANN.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Questions we can ask of a NN
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 

  <ul>
    <li>Image recognition</li>
    If we ask the NN to recognise objects in the image,
    it will output a set of numbers.
    The NN can be treated as a big function 
    that has a vector output (1 for horse, 1 for dog, 
    cat, sheep etc) and a big vector input. The most 
    basic question we can ask is, is there a sheep 
    in the image - true or false? We can generate a lot of 
    training data where someone tells the NN, yes there's 
    a sheep.

    <p>
      For this particular task, for every image we put in,
      the training data would say:
      a [1,0,0,0] for the ones that have only a sheep and 
      [0,1,0,0] for the ones that have a dog. 
      The network will predict a probability for each
      of its outputs. In practice, we take the largest 
      detection or we'll apply some threshold.
    </p>

    <li>Object detection</li>
    We now want to aim for 1 step higher than image
    recognition.

    <p>
      Here, we're not just wanting to know if 
      there's a sheep in the image or not, but we want to know
      where the sheep is. A box is place around the objects
      being detected. In 2d, a bounding box is placed,
      in 3d, an oriented bounding box or an axis aligned 
      bounding box is placed. We can now detect a dog and 
      a sheep potentially.      
    </p>

    <li>Semantic segmentation</li>
    We now want to the pixels in the image corresponding to
    our object. We have an image in and an image out instead
    of probabilities etc. Now, every pixel is labeled either
    a dog or a sheep or don't know.
    The training data for semantic segmentation would be
    similar.

    <p>
      <li>Instance segmentation</li>
      Different sheep are coloured differently 
      so that we can now tell there are multiple sheep and
      distinguish their boundaries.      
    </p>
    
    These are the basic questions for which 
    we have massive data sets to train with. 
    For manipulation, we want to ask more questions.

    <p>
      Achieving instance segmentation would already 
      power a lot of the manipulation pipelines. And hence
      we'd already be in good shape to do more.      
    </p>
    For instance, if we want to pick the cheez-it box
    from a cluttered bin, what we really want is an 
    instance segmentation pipeline that gives us
    the pixels associated with it. Then we can do
    antipodal grasping by restrict our search to the points 
    associated with just the cheez-it box.    
  </ul>
</section>

<section><h1>Outcome of creating the COCO dataset</h1>
  The COCO dataset was created by crowdsourcing it.
  People clicked pixel-by-pixel and labeled
  images. This powered instance segmentation labels 
  but was extremely expensive to to generate to begin 
  with. But once we had it a lot of things happened 
  very quickly. But, they couldn't have created labels
  for all the objects we care about.

  <p>
    The biggest results from all this deep learning for 
    perception is that these networks transfer 
    really well. We don't have to regenerate 
    a data set that compares with the size or quality of 
    labels of the coco data set. We can generate a very 
    small data set, fine-tune a network that 
    that was trained initially on the big labeled coco dataset
    and transfer it to our system/apply it to our problems.
  </p>

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/27_fineTuning.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        <a href="https://t.ly/A4Jr">Fine tuning</a>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 

  This is an important but simple pipeline to understand.
  It's surprising that it works. We've got a big multi-layer 
  network, that has got the original big imagenet or coco 
  trained model that we download from the web because 
  someone else spent a lot of GPU cloud resources to 
  train it from scratch. We can now apply 
  it to the objects we want to manipulate (not 
  elephants but a mustard bottle detector for instance),
  by choping off the head and using the remaining layers of the 
  network. Replace the output layer with the
  outputs we care about with some random initialization. 
  We can then train on our smaller dataset, that may be
  narrow and curated for our task. We don't have to retrain
  on the original dataset. 
  
  <p>
    Somehow magically the network 
    that was trained on the imagenet and coco datasets
    is able to capture enough understanding about 
    objects in images such that a relatively small amount 
    of training on a narrow data set seems to be all that
    is required to transfer that learning. This is one of
    the biggest success stories.
  </p>

  It took a dataset as big as imagenet to start 
  seeing this quality of generalisation. 
  
  <p>
    Question:
    <br>
    How do we know if at task is a good candidate for transfer 
    learning? This is an active research question.
    How far can you be from the original task in order 
    to still be successful with transfer learning.
    Nowadays people are trying to do
    self-supervised learning and trying to get a broader 
    initial network from just snarfing up the web. 
    There's some intuition that people have of the    
    distribution of the trained dataset and a metric
    of how similar a new distribution (task) can be.
    But, the differences can surprisingly be a lot,
    and the network still works.
  </p>
</section>

<section><h1>How to generate labels?</h1>
  How to generate the smaller amount of training data?

  <p>
    We can use Iterative Closest Point (ICP).
    Say we want to pick up a drill that is in a cluttered
    environment. A drill wasn't in the COCO dataset.
    People are now releasing coco sized datasets that have 
    depth information. Even if we're just going to train 
    an rgb based network (if we have the luxury of depth, 
    great!), we can do a <i>dense reconstruction</i> -
    we build an approximate CAD model or a 
    fused point cloud of all our scans. We can then 
    do ICP on the 3d view so we can find the drill 
    in the generated point cloud. We can then go through all 
    the images, pixel-by-pixel and automatically provide a
    label to the pixels that are the projected version of the 
    ICP fit.
  </p>
  
  By having a point cloud from all different sides, 
  we can make a nice point cloud which ICP can work on. 
  We can now re-render the image effectively with just the 
  green drill labeled in all the pixels. 
  We now have a lot of training data that is labeled drill 
  or not drill. A lot of companies do this. We called our
  pipeline labelfusion.

  <p>
    This way, we can generate lots of data very fast 
    but all of these images are very similar. They don't cover 
    a lot of diverse backgrounds. In fact, we could probably 
    down sample it dramatically and do just as well.
  </p>  

  People use this a lot. The hope when the project was started 
  was that we could write strong enough global 
  point cloud registration algorithms - the global versions 
  of ICP so that we could have it completely automated. If
  the robot could walk around, do its collection, it would 
  would find the drill and build the model.
  We would be generating data like crazy. 
  But ICP is not very robust unfortunately. So in practice,
  in order to make things work, we have a user interface 
  where after we take the scans, we have a human say 
  'look here for the drill' with 3 clicks to give a rough
  pose. ICP then takes those very approximate rapid clicks 
  (which permeates to all images because the gui that 
  the human clicks on is able to do that), finds the ICP for
  the whole dataset very fast and generates all the training
  images.
</section>

<section><h1>Simulation vs real world data generation</h1>
  ICP can converge close, but not quite.
  Even though it's an effective pipeline and generates 
  lots of data, even those imperfections of ICP are a 
  nuisance for the training process.

  <p>
    Simulation data with its perfect labels
    has started to contend well with natural data
    that has imperfect human labeled errors.
    One would think that natural data is
    always better than simulated data, but it's not true. 
    Because the pixel by pixel quality is better in sim, 
    even if the scenes are less diverse, people have 
    switched their pipelines 
    slowly from a purely real world data to using 
    purely simulated data to generate these training sets. 
  </p>
  
  People have also started using mostly 
  simulation data with a little bit of real-world data
  sprinnkled in just for good measure. 
</section>

<section><h1>The simulation pipeline</h1>
  Drake has an Rgbd sensor module that gives out depth,
  rgb colour and labeled images.
  It outputs an image that's the same size as what the camera
  would produce. 
  For the output of the labeled image, every pixel is assigned
  an integer value (pixels belonging to the same object have
  the same unique identifier) which is mapped with the hash to 
  what type of object it is. Drake adds in the colours
  based on the integer numbers for visualisation purpose.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/28_instanceSegmentation.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Drake's RGBD sensor
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 

  Drake knows about certain objects. For instance, 
  due to the presence of mustard.sdf, it can generate
  labeled images containing mustard bottles. Do we want to 
  use this known object pipeline on the deep network side?!

  <p>
    In the beginning, we tried hard to use the best
    renderers and the best ray tracers (to get shadows right).
    If you just want to pick some stuff, using tranfer
    learning, even opengl works fine. Only when building
    really high-end systems, do those details matter.
    We can very far even with poor quality graphics.    
  </p>
</section>

<section><h1>How to go from image recognition to 
  object detection</h1>
  We won't discuss architecture, just why we can ask
  questions like how many objects are in the scene. 
  
  <p>
    Object detection in its simplest 
    form is image recognition where we move a 
    sliding window across the image and ask the image 
    recognition question for each box. We then have a 
    threshold and only keep the boxes that have a high 
    recognition score.  
  </p>
  
  In <i>RCNN</i>, we have a lot of different 
  images of different sizes and different shapes. 
  We run each one of them through a convolutional network 
  and ask the basic yes, no questions. 
  This is how the first the object detectors were created.
  
  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/29_rcnn.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        RCNN
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 
  
  Nowadays people do more advanced versions, but 
  actually not crazy more advanced. Previously, it was 
  expensive to try every possible region. 
  So we tried to come up with some computer vision based
  criteria on what regions would be good regions to evaluate 
  to make the RCNN faster. 

  <p>
    Then, <i>Faster RCNN</i> came about and said
    let's use a NN to predict where the regions are. 
    That's the <i>Region Proposal Network</i>. 
    Then inside those regions, we'll do image recognition. 
    This is how things normally go. We start off with
    hand engineering something, then later replace it with
    a NN. And at some point we've got a completely deep 
    end-to-end thing. 
  </p>  

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/30_fastserRCNN.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Faster RCNN adds a region proposal network
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 

  The Region proposal network gives out initial guesses
  of where the regions are.  But, it not only asks if there
  is an object in a box (which is also an image),
  but also, if you were to do a small crop of that image 
  then would it be able to predict within the tighter 
  image (tighter bounding box) as well. So, the network 
  would also output a crop value - the new bounding box 
  regression.
  
  <p>
    It used to be the case that we would have a fixed length
    input and an output vector. For instance, the output
    vector would be the probability of being a sheep or dog
    [0.6, 0.2, 0.1..] etc.
  </p>

  If we have previously unknown number of objects in the 
  scene, how do we architect the network? How do we have 
  a variable number of outputs? We have multiple answers to 
  that these days but the initial way that worked 
  was using region proposal networks. Or just using any 
  thresholded regions - i.e. evaluate the network many times
  and then threshold. That led us to having a 
  variable number of object recognitions or object detections 
  in a single image.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
      src=
      "../../../figures/manipulation/31_maskRCNN.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        <a href="https://t.ly/RLJn">MaskRCNN</a>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div> 

  <i>MaskRCNN</i> involves the NN function where the input
  is an image and the output is the pixel-by-pixel 
  segmentation whether it's semantic or instance level. 
  It is a combination of FCN and FasterRCNN.
  It is a bit old, but still extremely good. MaskRCNN2
  is out now. There's a <a href="https://t.ly/n1-D">
  colab example</a> that does all of 
  the data generation, the training and fine-tuning of 
  the maskRCNN network for the clutter dataset.

  <p>
    When training deep models, 90% of the time is spent 
    writing the data loader, to get it right - we've been given an image, 
    but is it in the right format? Are the numbers from 
    0-255 or 0-1 etc. If we get it wrong the network still 
    learns something, but it doesn't learn the right thing. 
    And it's really hard to realize that we made a mistake 
    in the data loader. 
  </p>

  The mask that comes out of MRCNN in this example is just
  the mustard bottle. It's an instance level detector.
  If we change the indices, it will show the other mustard
  bottle.

  <p>
    We generated a reasonably big data set for this example,
    but a smaller dataset could have been used. The region
    proposals are quite bad. There are some good ones when cropped down. We don't see the messiness of the region proposals if we only see the final output.
  </p>

  This pipeline would work for antipodal grasping.
  Using this method, we could find the pixels corresponding to the mustard bottle, project them onto the point cloud to segment it, i.e. remove 
  all points that aren't associated with those 
  pixels. And then find the antipodal grasp on that.

  <p>
    There's a different notebook for generating the training data, one for training and one for testing. The training 
    takes hours.
  </p>    
</section>

<section><h1>Object representations</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Mesh model + pose</li>
    Here we feed the NN an input image and out comes the pose.
    Implicitly in order to generate the training data we had a model generated using mustardmodel.sdf for instance. All we need is the pose and we can start manipulating that object. 
  </ul>
</section>

<section><h1>Deep pose estimation</h1>
  ICP doesn't work globally. It's hard to beat geometric perception for really fine estimation of the pose. 
  But in terms of going from an image and having an initial guess, in the spirit of trying to find the needle in the haystack, deep learning pose estimation is a very nice approach. 
  
  <p>
    In DP2, we're going to learn not to use pose estimation because once we have a deep network at work we can ask richer questions that are less specific to single object representations. There are more interesting object representations. But it's very helpful to to map the stuff we've already seen into the deep learning context. It's the
    beginning of a marriage geometry and DL.
  </p>

  We're going to use our 1st method of object representation.
  Which representation of pose should we use? x,y,z is good. And for orientation:
  <ul>
    <li>Roll, pitch, yaw</li>
    Has singularities in its transform and a NN would have trouble
    learning it. But it's a great starting point. 

    <p>
      <li>Quaternions</li>
      The output is 4 real valued numbers (4 by 1) 
      $\in\mathbb{R}^4$. We also need to normalize it to make it a unit quaternion by including a last layer to the network that does the normalization - it would just take the derivatives through that normalization function. This representation can 
      have discontinuities but there are still better, more continuous representations.
    </p>

    <li>Axis angle</li>
    Similar to unit quaternions but doesn't need to be normalised. Also has discontinuities.

    <p>
      <li>Rotation matrix</li>
      We'll need to make sure to add in rotation matrix
      constraints ($RR^T=I, det(R) = 1$). 
      Rotation matrices basically parameterise the x,y,z
      vectors.
    </p>

    <li>Keypoints - x,y,z corners of a cube</li>
    <a href="https://bit.ly/3YZWGH5">Concept</a>.
  </ul>
  
  Deep networks learn continuous functions. A function that is a continuous function, as we change pose angles for instance, the output changes continuously, is going to be better for the NN to learn. There's a series of papers about on the continuity of rotation representations for deep learning cited in the notes. 

  <p>
    The discontinuities in our representations are a little sneaky. Imagine, in 2d, we want to parameterize the total pose angle using $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$, i.e. the output of the network will be between 0 and $2\pi$.
  </p>
  There are 2 rotations, $\epsilon$ and $2\pi - \epsilon$. The 2 should be close, but the wrapping gives a discontinuity in this representation. So, it's easy to create a rotation matrix:
  $
    \begin{bmatrix}c\theta & -s\theta
    \\s\theta & c\theta\end{bmatrix}
  $
  
  But it's hard to unwrap and go the other way to get the orientation because the rotation matrix is still a smooth continuous function. But, we've limited our pose angle to 
  a fixed range. So, unwrapping involves some decision making.
  
  <p>
    The network needs us to be unambiguous in our choice of orientation. Similar to euler angles, even quaternions are ambiguous because because negative of the quaternion is the same rotation as the positive of the quaternion. 
  </p>

  There is an argument (need to find this source) that there is no transformation from rotation matrices to quaternions that don't have singularities.
  

  <p></p>
  Ways to repair this problem:

    One way to repair this is to have 4 different rotation matrix to quaternion maps and combine all of their outputs to get a singularity free output. 

    <p>
      <li>SVD</li>
      We can also parameterise the rotation matrix as
      $\mathbb{R}^{3x3}$ and in the same way normalization was added as the last layer, we can add singular value decomposition so that we're projecting back to the closest rotation matrix.
    </p>
  </ul>

  Does adding more dimensions cause the redundancy to go up?
  That's not always true.

  <p>
    Imagine a simple rotation in $\theta$. We can represent every point using the 1st column of the rotation matrix i.e.$\begin{bmatrix}c\theta \\ s\theta\end{bmatrix}$ and ask the network to learn this. Even though it's more dimensions, we get a unique answer using the 2 numbers. It's the constraint $c^2\theta + s^2\theta = 1$ that saves us.
  </p>
  
  Even in 4d, there's a unit quaternion constraint so we only really have 3 variables.
  
  <p>
    These methods are able to resolve ambiguities in rotation only if the object is rotationally unique, i.e. it doesn't have any rotational symmetries. In practice there's all sorts of ambiguity in rotations - there are shapes that are perfectly symmetric around some rotations or there are things that are just ambiguous because of partial views.
    For example, determining the pose of a mug without seeing its handle is ambiguous because it's symmetric until we see the handle. People have tried to learn an uncertainty representation (if we can't see the mug's handle, we have less confidence of its pose) along with orientations to give some confidence with labels (KOSNet paper). 
  </p>

  The way forward is to output a distribution over poses.

  <p>
    There are a lot of objects that are rotationally symmetric in one axis so the KOSNet paper focused its distribution representation on each axis independently. If we use euler angles for instance, it output a gaussian distribution (a mean and a covariance) for each euler angle. And that worked for mugs. When we see a mug with a handle, the uncertainty becomes narrow as opposed to being broader when no handle is seen. 
  </p>

  Generating labels for objects that are partially symmetric is tough. Using just CAD models, how do we say that the uncertainty distribution should be narrow or broad in certain regions. In mugs, we can hack it a bit (did it in the paper) by numerical differencing of images. But, it's a hard problem more generally. 
  
  <p>
    We have to change the loss function to a maximum likelihood formulation. In getting the network to output a distribution over poses, if the maximum likelihood of the distribution it's producing has high probability in the true training set, then we should be happy; instead of matching the entire distribution to our training set because we can't produce that.
  </p>

  For each of the orientation representations, it is interesting to think what loss function would suit best. For instance, with quaternions we want to use geodesic distance as a loss function instead of L2 loss.

  <p>
    The overall summary/interesting idea here is that we can train a distribution over poses by only getting samples from the distribution instead of getting labels representing the entire distribution.

  What are the right ways to write distributions over orientations. Bingham distribution is a reasonable way to write distributions over unit quaternions.

  Jared glover's picture representation in his thesis gives a very good mental picture. He did it in the context of a robot playing ping-pong. 
  
  <p>
    How do we put a distribution over quaternions i.e. over the unit sphere in 4 dimensions that is also antipodal? Gaussians don't do very well out of the box. Something about the probability of picking q is the same as that of picking -q. Also, renormalising the gaussian over the unit circle and then applying some constraint + changing the covariance of the gaussian + what does it mean to have a 0 eigenvalue? Normalisation is a pain - something about integrating on the sphere. But one would be happier with Binghams if they were just happy with unnormalised probabilities. Jared was trying to estimate the spin of a ping pong ball using this method. There's also deep bingham network. The output of the network becomes the covariance matrix.
  </p>
  
  So, instead of estimating a single pose, it is best to use the NN to make multiple pose hypotheses with associated uncertainties i.e. solutions in the form of full probability distributions. Choosing the right network output for the poses makes a big difference.
</section>

<section><h1>Does this really matter in practice</h1>
  If a data set has a million samples and discontinuities only happen in a very small fraction, does it matter?
  
  <p>
    We could say the same thing about euler angles and humanoid robots - it would work well, but if ever the robot was completely horizontal, then we'd be in trouble. Similarly, if we can guarantee our application isn't going to see objects that are near some singularity, then we can use a simpler representation. We've been using NNs effectively all this time without these tricks.
  </p>

<section><h1>Closing remarks</h1>
  There are different ways to generate data for training. One method is the fine tuning/transfer learning method where we pick the trained network that was trained closest to our dataset, chop the head off and train it for our task.

  <p>
    Can we train another task for which it is easier to generate training data and do transfer learning on that trained network? How far can we go with the retargeting?
    These are the questions of self-supervised learning. Find a way (example, by mining the web) to provide labels without explicit supervision, then retarget the backbone of that network with its learned features to our task.
  </p>

  An example is training monocular cameras. We can use stereovision to predict depth. Can we then ask the question, hide the input from the 2nd camera, can we train to predict the depth just using the 1st camera? Training this task seems to learn a lot of geometric information about the world which could be useful to retarget.

      <li>Generating training data for manipulation</li>
      <li>Recognition and segmentation pipeline</li>
      There's a notebook to play with MaskRCNN
      <li>Deep pose estimation</li>
      Make sure to understand both geometry as well as deep network pose estimation methods.
