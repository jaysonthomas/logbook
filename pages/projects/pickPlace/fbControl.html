  The commanded ee twist $V$ expressed in ${e}$.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Method</h1>
  Find the following:
  <ul>      
    <li>Error twist</li>
    $[V_{err}]=log(X^{-1}X_{d})$
    <br>
    $X$ is the current configuration of {e} w.r.t. {s}.
    <br>
    $X_{d}$ is the desired/reference configuration of {e} w.r.t. {s}.
    
    <p>
      <li>Feedforward reference twist</li>
      $[V_{d}] = \frac{1}{\Delta{t}}log(X^{-1}_{d} X_{d,next})$

      <p>
        A logarithm typically represents an instantaneous change to go between 2 configurations $X_{d}$ to $X_{d,next}$; a change that is so small that it can be considered to occur over an infinitely small period of time. This is called an <i>infinitesimal motion</i>. In order to map the instantaneous motion to a motion that occurs over a finite period of time $\Delta{t}$, the output of the logarithm is divided/scaled by $\Delta{t}$. The resulting velocity is kept constant for the time interval: $v\Delta{t} = \Delta{X}$
      </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>Commanded ee twist</li>
      $V_{ee} = FF + P + I$
      <br>
      $V(t)=[Ad_{X^{-1}X_{d}}]V_{d}(t)+K_{p}X_{err}(t)+K_{i}\int_{0} ^{t}X_{err}dt$
      <br>
      $FF$ consists of the reference twist after mapping it
      to the current frame of the ee.
      <br>
      The error twist is used in the P and I terms.

      <p>
        <m>What if the twist to go from $X$ to $X_d$ wasn't considered in the FF term; i.e. leave the PI terms to take care of the error?</m>
      </p>
    </p>
    
    <li>Commanded wheel and joint speeds</li>
    $V_{ee}$ needs to be expressed in the wheel and joint space
    using the pseudoinverse of the mobile manipulator jacobian.
    <br>
    $\begin{bmatrix}u\\\dot{\theta}\end{bmatrix} = J^{\dagger}_{e}(\theta)V$
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Tests</h1>
  <ul>
    <p>
      <li>
        Given current, desired and the next desired configurations, find
        $V_{d}$, $[Ad_{X^{-1}X_{d}}]V_{d}$, $V_{ee}$, $V_{err}$, $J_{e}$ and $(u,\dot{\theta})$
      </li>
      <p>
        Between$X_{d}$ to $X_{d,next}$, the orientation is the same; just the linear components change.
        Keep one larger than the others and the velocity (the FF term) should reflect the same. 
        There should be no angular velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        With $X_{err}$, correction only needs to be applied to the ee's orientation in the y direction.
        And some translation error needs to applied which will lead to the bot moving with constant speed
        in all wheels. This can be checked by confirming $(u,\dot{\theta})$.
      </p>
      <p>
        These tests show how I can keep the tests simple by setting certain parameters of the bot, constant.

<section id="4"><h1>Handling joint singularities</h1>
  <subsection id="4.0"><h1>What are these singularities?</h1>
    <p>
      If the <i>6x9</i> jacobian matrix $J_{e}$ is singular or nearly singular
      in a particular direction,
      the pseudoinverse algorithm $J^{\dagger}_{e}$ will generate unreasonably large
      entries which will lead to unacceptably large commanded joint speeds even if we 
      ask for a small twist in that direction. The jacobian matrix is singular when its rank
      drops below 6. This will only be seen in the joint space.
    </p>
    <p>
      An option is to ignore commanded twist components (in $V_{ee}$) that the near-singularity
      renders difficult to achieve. Set a tolerance; if a value is lower than the tolerance value
      (so, the value is even closer to 0), then treat the component as 0. In any case, place
      reasonable limits on the maximum joint/wheel speeds to mimic limitation of a real robot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Why does the robot arm always seem to approach a singularity at the start?</i>
      <br>
      The controller tends to make the robot arm approach a singularity (e.g. straighten out)
      before the wheels move much to help move the ee. This has something to do with the
      properties of the pseudoinverse; the way it extracts a single solution
      ($x=A^{\dagger}b$ for the equation $Ax=b$) when there are many solutions for $x$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would things change if the wheels had a much larger radius?
    </p>
    <p>
      Source for the following: <a href="rebrand.ly/l8bxnj1">this mit paper</a>.
      <br>
      A recurring problem in tracking target positions, 
      is that when the target positions are too distant, the multibody's
      arms stretch out to try to reach the target position. Once the multibody is
      extended in this way, it usually is near a singularity (that is, the Jacobian
      very sensitive to small changes in joint angles), and the multibody will often
      shake or jitter, attempting unsuccessfully to reach the distant target.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a singularity, the Jacobian matrix no longer has full row
      rank, corresponding to the fact that there is a direction of movement of the
      end effectors which is not achievable. If the configuration is exactly at a
      singularity, then the pseudoinverse method will not attempt to move in an
      impossible direction, and the pseudoinverse will be well-behaved. However,
      if the configuration is close to a singularity, then the pseudoinverse method
      will lead to very large changes in joint angles, even for small movements in
      the target position.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection id="4.1"><h1>Choosing joint limits</h1>
    <p>
      Joint limits are needed to avoid self collisions and singularities.
      For example, constraints can be added to joints 3 and 4 to always be
      less than 0.2 radians. Thus the arm will avoid singularities occurring
      when joints 3 or 4 are at the zero angle. Use the joint angle sliders to
      approximately find the joint-angle combinations that avoid self-collisions [Scene 3].
    </p>
    <p>
      But it should not be so conservative that the arm's workspace is overly constrained, 
      preventing the robot from doing useful work.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection id="4.2"><h1>Code implementation</h1>
    <p>
      Write a function to return a list of joints that violate the limits 
      given the robot arm's current configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initial configuration must satisfy joint limits.</li>
        <li>
          Each time ($u,\dot{\theta}$) is found, check the new
          configuration (after $\Delta{t}$) does not violate the joint limits.
        </li>
        <p>
          <li>If yes, recalculate the controls.</li>
          <p>
            Change each column of $J_{e}$ corresponding to an offending joint
            to all zeros. The pseudoinverse solution will not request any motion from these joints.
          </p>
        </p>
