  <ul>
    <li>Getting the notations right</li>
    Even in deep neural networks (say to calculate pose estimation), we're going to have a kinematics problem at some point and we're going to have a bug where the vectors are pointing the wrong way etc. If we get the notations right, spatial algebra will protect us.

    <p>
      <li>Choosing our frames</li>
      We have a gripper and a gripper frame; an object and an object frame. To grasp, we need to get the gripper frame in the right relative orientation and position to the object frame. 
    </p>

    <li>Trajectory generation</li>
    We'll plot the frames (the sketch) for the open-loop trajectory with the aim of the gripper picking up and dropping off a brick at a desired location. We forget the rest of the robot and just decide the different trajectory of poses the hand needs to go through in space at different timestamps; and then fill it out with interpolation.

    <p>
      <li>Inverse kinematics</li>
      We map the gripper plan sketch to moving the whole arm.
    </p>
  </ul>

  <subsection id="0.0"><h1>Basic strategy</h1>
    We have designed the gripper poses as a function of time using a trajectory generator and our aim is obtain corresponding joint positions as a function of time:

    $$
      X^G(t) \rightarrow q(t)
    $$

    The controller takes joint positions as input so we need to go from EE coordinates to joint commands. We start with a $q(0)$ and integrate forward using the joint velocity for that instant. The joint velocity is obtained by taking the inverse jacobian of the spatial velocity:

    $$
      \dot{q}(t) = [J^G(q)]^{-1}V^G(t)
    $$
    $V^G(t)$ is the spatial velocity of the gripper as a function of time.

    <p>
      We need to make sure the matrix is invertible or address it with more sophisticated methods. But intuitively we're going to design controllers that use the derivative of the kinematics (jacobian is approximately the derivative of FK) to get the smoothness in joint position transitions from one time instant to the next. 
    </p>

    We want to convert the smooth trajectory in EE coordinates to a smooth trajectory in the joint space, avoiding kinematic sigularities.

    <p>
      Summary: Use the reference trajectory to get $V_G$. Use Jacobian to get $\dot{q}$ which helps us to get $q(t)$ (integrating our way from q(0)) which is fed in as input. We need to avoid singularities by ensuring the Jacobian is invertible.
