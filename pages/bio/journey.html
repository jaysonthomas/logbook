<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Career journey</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Past</h1>
  I started off developing proof of concepts in the embedded sensors domain. From a technical standpoint, this involved:
  <ul>
    <li>Understanding the measurable characteristics of a physical environment and thereby deciding on the type of sensor.</li>
    <li>Evaluating off-the-shelf sensors.</li>
    <li>Designing the electronics around the sensor.</li>
    Both analog and digital. In some cases this involved mechanical design as well

    <li>Writing firmware code to capture and process sensor measurements.</li>
    <li>Post data analysis.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Current</h1>
  Currently, I am a Seniour Software Engineer at Ocado in the motion control (mobile robotics) team. My work has spanned over the following areas:
  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

</section>


</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Interests</h1>
  I find the following domains interesting because they make use of maths and physics to describe and solve problems.
  <ul>
    <li>Optimisation based methods like LQR, MPC to solve control problems</li>
    <li>Probabilistic methods for state estimation like the different Bayes filters</li>
    <li>Classical computer vision methods for object segmentation and detection</li>
    Especially in the fields of manipulation and environment mapping.
    <li>Motion (trajectory) planning</li>
  </ul>

  These interests would need to be backed up with:
  <ul>
    <li>Simulation</li>
    <li>Embedded programming on hardware</li>
    <li>Data analysis</li>
  </ul>

  I don't mention deep learning as an interest for now as it takes away the physics component for me.
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Where am I in my career</h1>
  Overtime, my desire to get back into core robotics has grown. My interest, these days, center around:
  <ul>
    <li>Design of control systems for underactuated systems (includes 3D kinematics and dynamics)</li>
    <li>Simultaneous localisation (based on bayes filters) and mapping in unstructured environments</li>

    <li>Path planning in unstructured environments</li>
    <li>Computer vision</li>
    I haven't yet delved into deep NNs, but I am very impressed by transfer learning i.e. getting a network trained in a particular domain to work in an unrelated domain and it's something I would be keen to explore in the future.
  </ul>

  <p>
    In my current role, I do a lot of work in the design and deployment of motion planning, control and localisation methods for fleets of bots in structured environments and I am very keen for the challenge that unstructured environments pose.
